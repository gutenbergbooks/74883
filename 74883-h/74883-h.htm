  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Shemsuddin Mahommad, better known by his poetical
surname of Hafiz, was born in Shiraz in the early
part of the fourteenth century.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> His names, being
interpreted, signify the Sun of the Faith, the Praiseworthy,
and One who can recite the Koran; he is
further known to his compatriots under the titles
of the Tongue of the Hidden and the Interpreter
of Secrets. The better part of his life was spent
in Shiraz, and he died in that city towards the close
of the century. The exact date either of his birth
or of his death is unknown. He fell upon turbulent
times. His delicate love-songs were chanted to the
rude accompaniment of the clash of arms, and his
dreams must have been interrupted often enough by
the nip of famine in a beleaguered town, the inrush
of conquerors, and the flight of the defeated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The history of Persia in the fourteenth century
is exceedingly confused. Beyond a succession of wars
and turmoils, there is little to be learnt concerning
the political conditions under which Hafiz lived.
Fifty years before the birth of the poet, Hulagu,
a grandson of the great Tartar invader Chinghis
Khan, had conquered Baghdad, putting to death the
last of the Abbaside Khalifs and extinguishing the
direct line of the race that had ruled over Persia
since 750. For the next 200 years there is indeed
a branch of the family of Abbas living in Cairo,
members of which were set up as Khalifs by the
Mamluk  Sultans of Egypt; but they were destitute
of any real authority, and their position was that
of dependants in the Mamluk court.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sons and grandsons of Hulagu succeeded him
as lords of Persia and Mesopotamia, paying a nominal
allegiance to the Great Khan of the Mongols in Cambalec
or Pekin, but for all practical purposes independent,
and the different provinces of their empire
were administered by governors in their name.
About the time of the birth of Hafiz, that is to say
in the beginning of the fourteenth century, a certain
Mahmud Shah Inju was governing the province of
Fars, of which Shiraz is the capital, in the name of
Abu Said, the last of the direct descendants of
Hulagu. On the death of Mahmud Shah, Abu
Said appointed Sheikh Hussein ibn Juban to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>governorship of Fars, a lucrative and much-coveted
post. Sheikh Hussein took the precaution of ordering
the three sons of Mahmud Shah to be seized
and imprisoned; but while they were passing through
the streets of Shiraz in the hands of their captors,
their mother, who accompanied them, lifted her
veil and made a touching appeal to the people,
calling upon them to remember the benefits they
had received from their late ruler, the father of
the three boys. Her words took instant effect; the
inhabitants rose, released her and her sons, and
drove Sheikh Hussein into exile. He, however,
returned with an army supplied by Abu Said, and
induced Shiraz to submit again to his rule. In
1335, a year or two after these events, Abu Said
died, and the power of the house of Hulagu crumbled
away. There followed a long period of anarchy,
which was brought to an end when Oweis, another
descendant of Hulagu, seized the throne. He and
his son Ahmed reigned in Baghdad until Ahmed
was driven out by the invading army of Timur.
But during the years of anarchy the authority of
the Sultan of Baghdad had been considerably curtailed.
On Abu Said’s death, Abu Ishac, one of
the three sons of Mahmud Shah Inju who had so
narrowly escaped from the hands of Sheikh Hussein,
took possession of Shiraz and Isfahan, finally ousting
his old enemy, while Mahommad ibn Muzaffar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>who had earned a name for valour in the service of
Abu Said, made himself master of Yezd.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this time onward the governors of the
Persian provinces seem to have given a nominal
allegiance now to the Sultan of Baghdad, now to
the more distant Khalif. The position of Shiraz
between Baghdad and Cairo must have resembled
that of Venice between Rome and Constantinople,
and, like Venice, she was obedient to neither lord.</p>

<p class='c009'>Abu Ishac had not steered his bark into quiet
waters. In 1340 Shiraz was besieged and taken by
a rival Atabeg, and the son of Mahmud Shah was
obliged to content himself with Isfahan. But in the
following year he returned, captured Shiraz by a
stratagem, and again established himself as ruler
over all Fars. The remaining years of his reign
are chiefly occupied with military expeditions against
Yezd, where Mahommad ibn Muzaffar and his sons
were building up a formidable power. In 1352,
determined to put an end to these attacks, Mahommad
marched into Fars and laid siege to Shiraz.
Abu Ishac, whose life was one of perpetual dissipation,
redoubled his orgies in the face of danger.
Uncertain of the fidelity of the people of Shiraz,
he put to death all the inhabitants of two quarters
of the town, and contemplated insuring himself of
a third quarter in a similar manner. But these
measures did not lead to the desired results. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>chief of the threatened quarter got wind of the
King’s design, and delivered up the keys of his gate
to Shah Shudja, son of Mahommad ibn Muzaffar,
and Abu Ishac was obliged to seek refuge a second
time in Isfahan. Four years later, in 1357, he was
given up to Mahommad, who sent him to Shiraz and,
with a fine sense of dramatic fitness, had him beheaded
in an open space before the ruins of Persepolis.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arab traveller Ibn Batuta, who visited
Shiraz between the years 1340 and 1350, has left
a description of its ruler: “Abu Ishac,” says he,
“is one of the best Sultans that can be found”
(it must be confessed that the average of Sultans
was not very high in Ibn Batuta’s time); “he is fair
of face, imposing of presence, and his conduct is
no less to be admired. His mind is generous, his
character remarkable, and he is modest although his
power is great and his territories extensive. His
army exceeds the number of 30,000 men, Turks and
Persians. The most faithful of his subjects are the
inhabitants of Isfahan; but he fears the Shirazis, who
are a brave people, not to be controlled by kings,
and he will not trust them with arms.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> This view
of his relations with the two towns tallies with Abu
Ishac’s subsequent history, and points to a considerable
power of observation on the part of Ibn Batuta.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>But he relates a tale which would seem to show that
Abu Ishac was not unpopular even in Shiraz: on a
certain occasion he wished to build a great gate in
that city, and hearing of his desire the inhabitants
vied with each other in their eagerness to satisfy it;
men of all ranks turned out to do the work, putting
on their best clothes and digging the foundations
with spades of silver. Abu Ishac shared the passion
of the age for letters, and was anxious to be accounted
a rival to the King of Delhi in his generosity
to men of learning; “but,” sighs Ibn Batuta, “how
far is the earth removed from the Pleiades!” The
Persian historian who describes Abu Ishac’s execution,
quotes a quatrain which the Atabeg is supposed
to have written while he was in prison:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lay down thine arms when Fortune is thy foe,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Gainst Heaven’s wheel, Wrestler, try not a throw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drink steadfastly the cup whose name is Death,</div>
      <div class='line'>Empty the dregs upon the earth, and go.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So perished the first patron of Hafiz.</p>

<p class='c009'>From 1353 to 1393, when Timur conquered Shiraz
for the second and last time, the greater part of
Persia was ruled by members of the house of
Muzaffar. Scarcely a year passed undisturbed by
civil war, scarcely a year in which one of the sons
or grandsons of Mahommad did not suffer imprisonment
or worse ills at the hands of his brothers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Mahommad himself was the first to fall. Shah
Shudja seized his father while he was reading the
Koran aloud with a poet of his court, and caused
him to be blinded. A few years later the grim life
beat itself out against the prison walls of Ka’lah-i-Safid.
“Without just cause,” sings Hafiz, “the
victor of victors suffered imprisonment; guiltless,
the mightiest head was laid low. He had overcome
Shiraz and Tabriz and Irak; at the last his own hour
came. He who, in the eyes of the world, was the
light he had kindled (<em>i.e.</em> Mahommad’s son, Shah
Shudja), through those eyes which had gazed victorious
upon the world, thrust the hot iron.” A
stern and pitiless man was this Mahommad, brave
in battle, wise in council, ardent in religion, but
hard and cruel beyond measure, a perfidious friend
and a relentless enemy. The Persian historian, Lutfallah,
relates that on several occasions he had seen
criminals brought before Mahommad while the
Amir was engaged in reading the Koran. Laying
the book aside, he would draw his sword and kill
the offenders as they stood, and then return unmoved
to his devotions. Shah Shudja once asked his father
whether he had killed 1000 men with his own hand.
“No,” replied Mahommad, “but I think that the
number of them that I have slain must reach 800.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After his death, Shah Shudja reigned in Shiraz,
and his brother Shah Yahya in Yezd. Shah Shudja
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>was a man of like energy with his father, but it was
an energy directed into different channels; the stern
religious ardour of the elder man was changed into
a spirit of frenzied dissipation in the younger.
Whenever he was not engaged in conducting expeditions
against his brothers and nephews, he was
taking part in the wildest orgies in Shiraz. He
was scarcely less cruel than Mahommad. In a fit of
drunkenness he ordered one of his own sons to be
blinded, and though, at the instance of his vizir,
he repented and sent a second messenger hot foot
after the first, it was already too late to save the
boy. Before Shah Shudja’s death the knell of the
house of Muzaffar had sounded—Tamberlain and his
Tartar hordes had advanced into Northern Persia.
In 1382 Shah Shudja sent a propitiatory embassy
to him with gifts—jewels and silks, horses, a scarlet
daïs, a royal standard, and a Chinese umbrella; and
Timur in return sent the King a robe of honour
and a belt studded with jewels.</p>

<p class='c009'>Worn out before his time with riotous living, Shah
Shudja did his utmost to secure the welfare of his
family before he died. He sent letters both to Timur
and to Sultan Ahmed of Baghdad recommending to
their protection his son Zein-el-Abeddin, his brothers,
and his nephews. The curtain is drawn aside for a
moment from the death-bed of the King, and an anecdote,
such as Oriental historians love, reveals to us the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>fearless and terrible face. Hearing that his brother
Ahmed was preparing to dispute the succession with
Zein-el-Abeddin, he sent for him in order to persuade
him to withdraw his claims. But when Ahmed
entered the room where Shah Shudja lay sick to
death, both brothers burst into tears, and Ahmed
was so much overcome by emotion that he was
obliged to withdraw. Thereupon Shah Shudja sent
him a letter by the hand of a faithful servant. “The
world,” he said, “is like unto the shadow of a cloud
and a dream of the night; for the one has no resting-place,
and when the dreamer awakens there remains
to him but a vain memory of the other. I foresee
much disturbance in Shiraz; Kerman is the home of
our fathers. I have no complaint to lay at your
door; but now that I am about to fare upon a long
journey, if you were to become a sower of discord,
not I alone would reproach you, but God also; and
our enemies would rejoice. Go therefore to Kerman
and renounce this unhappy city.” And Ahmed
went.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shah Shudja died in the odour of sanctity. Ten
holy men were with him continually, reading the
Koran aloud from end to end each day. He left
behind him a name renowned for courage and for
liberality. He was a poet, after the fashion of
kings, and from boyhood he could repeat the Koran
by heart.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The son, whose future he had spent his last hours
in assuring, was not to remain for long upon the
throne bequeathed to him by his father. During
his short reign, Zein-el-Abeddin was engaged in
defending himself from the attacks of his cousin
Mansur, but in 1388 he was obliged to flee before
an enemy more terrible than any he had yet known.
Timur, who for several years had been hovering
upon the borders of Fars, overran Southern Persia
and took Shiraz. Zein-el-Abeddin sought refuge
with Mansur, who repaid his confidence by imprisoning
and blinding him. It must have been in the
year 1388 that the celebrated interview between
Hafiz and Timur took place (see note to Poem <a href='#V'>V</a>.),
and not at the time of the second conquest of Shiraz
in 1393. The confusion between the two dates has
led several writers to doubt the truth of the story,
since it is almost certain that the poet had died
before 1393. Timur bestowed Shiraz upon Shah
Yahya, uncle to Mansur, and some time governor of
Yezd; but no sooner was the Tartar army called
away by disturbances in the northern parts of the
empire than Mansur overthrew his uncle and possessed
himself of Shiraz. Hafiz did not live to see
the end of the drama, but the end was not far off.
In 1393 Timur advanced with 30,000 picked men
against Mansur. The Muzaffaride, with only 3000
or 4000 men, twice charged into the heart of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Tartar force, and at one moment Timur’s own life
was in danger. Mansur, who was himself fighting
in the thickest of the battle, sent a message back to
the wings of his army, ordering them to support his
desperate charge; but they did not obey his command.
He fell fighting beneath the sword of Shah
Rukh Mirza, Timur’s son, leaving the conqueror to
“march in triumph through Persepolis.” Courage
was a quality in which the descendants of Mahommad
ibn Muzaffar were not deficient, but among a race of
soldiers Mansur seems to have been distinguished
for his reckless bearing. He, too, like the other
members of his family, was a patron of learning, and
it is related that he used to distribute 200 tomans
daily among the poor scholars of Shiraz. Both on
account of their popularity and of their bravery,
Timur saw that there would be no peace for him in
Shiraz while one member of the house of Muzaffar
remained alive; Mansur’s survivors were put to the
sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>Through all these changes of fortune, Hafiz appears
to have played the prudent, if rather unromantic
part of the Vicar of Bray. The slender
thread of his personal history is made up for the
most part of more or less mythical anecdote. He
was the son, according to one tradition, of a baker
of Shiraz, in which city he was probably educated.
The poet Jami says that he does not know under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>what Sufi doctor Hafiz studied. As a young man,
however, he was one of the followers of Sheikh
Mahmud Attar, who would seem to have been somewhat
of a free-lance among the learned men of
Shiraz. Sheikh Mahmud did not give himself up
completely to the contemplative life, but combined
the functions of a teacher with those of a
dealer in fruit and vegetables. “Oh disciple of the
tavern!” sings Hafiz, “give me the precious goblet,
that I may drink to the Sheikh who has no monastery.”
Sheikh Mahmud’s attitude doubtless brought
him under the condemnation of the stricter Sufis,
of the disciples of a certain Sheikh Hassan Asrakpush
in particular, who, as the title of their master
denotes, clad themselves only in blue garments, and
declared that their minds were filled with heavenly
desires, just as their bodies were clothed in the
colour of heaven. Hafiz falls foul of this rival
school in several of his poems. “I am the servant,”
he says, “of all who scatter the dregs of the cup
and are clothed in one colour (that is, clothed in
sincerity), but not of them whose bodies are clad
in blue while black is the colour of their heart.”
And again: “Give me not the cup until I have
torn from my breast the blue robe,” by which he
means that he cannot receive the teachings of
true wisdom until he has divested himself of the
errors of the uninitiated. From Sheikh Mahmud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>perhaps, he learnt a wholesome philosophy which
enabled him to see through the narrow-minded
asceticism of other religious teachers, whether Sufi
or orthodox, and he was not unmindful of the debt
he owed him. “My Grey-Beard,” he sings, “who
scatters the dregs of the wine, has neither gold nor
power, but God has made him both munificent and
merciful.” And indeed if he succeeded in unchaining
the spirit of his disciple from useless prejudice,
it may be admitted that the Sheikh went far
towards providing him with a good equipment for
life. Although he never submitted to any strict
monastic rule, Hafiz assumed the dervish habit of
which he speaks so contemptuously. We must
suppose that he took the precaution, which he
himself recommends, of washing it clean in the
wine that Sheikh Mahmud provided for him; in
other words, that he tempered his orthodoxy with
the freer doctrines he had derived from his teacher.
He also became a sheikh.</p>

<p class='c009'>How he first revealed his inimitable gift of song
is not known. There is a tradition that upon a
certain day one of his uncles was engaged in composing
a poem upon Sufiism, and being but a mediocre
poetaster, could get no further than the first line.
Hafiz took up the sheet in his uncle’s absence and
completed the verse. The uncle was not a little
annoyed; he bade Hafiz finish the poem, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the same time cursed him and his works. “They
shall bring insanity,” he declared, “upon all that
read them.” Men say that the curse still hangs over
the Divan, therefore let no one whose reason is not
strongly seated venture to study the poet. Whatever
were his beginnings, it was not long before the
young man rose into high repute. Abu Ishac was
his first patron. “By the favour of the victorious
standards of a king,” says Hafiz, “I was uplifted
like a banner among the makers of verse.” There
is a long poem addressed to Abu Ishac, in which
he is called the King under whose feet the garden
of his kingdom bursts into flower. “Oh great and
holy!” cries the poet, “every man who is a servant
of thine is uplifted so high that the stars of Gemini
are but as his girdle.” Hafiz must have been in
Shiraz when Abu Ishac was brought thither, a
prisoner, from Isfahan; he may even have witnessed
his execution outside Persepolis. “Fate overtook
him,” he sighs, “all too speedily—alas for the
violence and oppression in this world of pitfalls!
alas for the grace and the mercy that dwelt among
us! Hast thou not heard, oh Hafiz, the laugh of
the strutting partridge? Little considered be the
clutching talons of the falcon of death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>From the protection of Abu Ishac, Hafiz passed
into that of Shah Shudja, but the relations between
the two men seem to have been somewhat strained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Shah Shudja may have distrusted the loyalty of one
to whom Abu Ishac had been so good a patron;
moreover, he nursed a professional jealousy of Hafiz,
being himself a writer of occasional verse. The historian
Khondamir tells of an interview which cannot
have increased the goodwill of either interlocutor
towards the other. Shah Shudja reproached Hafiz
with the discursiveness of his songs. “In one and
the same,” he said, “you write of wine, of Sufiism, and
of the object of your affections. Now this is contrary
to the practice of the eloquent.” “That which your
Majesty has deigned to speak,” replied Hafiz (laying
his tongue in his cheek, though Khondamir does not
mention the fact), “is the essence of the truth; yet
the poems of Hafiz enjoy a wide celebrity, whereas
those of some other writers have not passed beyond
the gates of Shiraz.” But an occasional bandying
of sharp speeches, in which the King usually came off
second best, did little harm to a friendship which
was based upon a marked correspondence in tastes.
“Since the hour,” declares Hafiz, “that the wine-cup
received honour from Shah Shudja, Fortune has put
the goblet of joy into the hand of all wine-drinkers”;
and in several poems he welcomes Shah Shudja’s
accession to the throne and the consequent removal
of an edict against the drinking of wine: “The
daughter of the grape has repented of her retirement;
she went to the keeper of the peace (<em>i.e.</em> Shah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Shudja) and received permission for her deeds. Forth
came she from behind the curtain that she might tell
her lovers that she has turned about.” Partly out
of gratitude, partly with an eye to future favours,
Hafiz proclaimed the glory of Shah Shudja, just as
he had proclaimed that of the hapless Abu Ishac,
and the King was not averse from such good wishes as
these from the most famous poet of the age: “May
the ball of the heavens be for ever in the crook of
thy polo stick, and the whole world be a playing-ground
unto thee. The fame of thy goodness has
conquered the four quarters of the earth; may it be
for all time a guardian unto thee!”</p>

<p class='c009'>One of Shah Shudja’s vizirs, Hadji Kawameddin
Hassan, was also a good friend to Hafiz.
In the poems he is frequently alluded to as the
second Assaf (the first Assaf having been King
Solomon’s vizir, renowned for his wisdom), while
Shah Shudja masquerades under the title of Solomon
himself. On his return from a journey, probably
to Yezd, Hafiz spent some months in the house of
the Vizir—induced thereto by a cogent argument.
In one of the poems there is a dialogue between
himself and a friend, in which the friend says to
him, “When after two years’ absence thy destiny
has brought thee home, why comest thou not out
of thy master’s house?” Hafiz replies that the
road in which he walks is not of his choosing: “An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>officer of my judge stands, like a serpent, in ambush
upon the path, and whenever I would pass beyond
my master’s threshold he serves me with a summons
and hurries me back into my prison.” He goes on
to remark that under these painful circumstances he
finds his master’s house a sure refuge, and the servants
of the Vizir useful allies against the officers of
the law. “If any one proffers a demand to me
there, I call to my aid the strong arm of one of the
Vizir’s dependants, and with a blow I cause his skull
to be cleft in two.” A summary manner, one would
think, of dealing with the law, and little calculated to
incline the heart of his judge towards the offender.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is another Khawameddin who is frequently
mentioned, the Vizir of Sultan Oweis of Baghdad.
He founded in Shiraz a college for Hafiz, in which
the poet gave lectures on the Koran, and read out
his own verses, and whither his fame drew a great
number of pupils. We find Hafiz asking his benefactor
for money to support this school in the
following terms: “Oh discreet friend (my poem),
in some retired spot to which even the wind is a
stranger, come to the ear of the master, and between
jest and earnest place the pointed saying, that his
heart may consent unto it; then, of thy kindness,
pray his munificence to tell me, if I were to ask for
a small stipend, would my request be tolerated?”
One cannot but hope that so charming a begging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>letter, couched in verse withal, was more than tolerated.
It was probably this Vizir who sent a robe
of honour to Hafiz which, when it came, proved to
be too short for him; “but,” says the poet politely,
“no favour of thine could be too short for any
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>From Oweis himself Hafiz is said to have received
kindness, but he does not seem to have been satisfied
with the Sultan’s conduct towards him: “From
my heart,” he says, “I am the slave of Sultan Oweis,
but he remembers not his servant.” The son of
Oweis, Sultan Ahmed of Baghdad, whose cruelty
caused his subjects to call in the aid of Timur
against him, was very anxious to induce Hafiz to
visit his court; but Hafiz, perhaps with prudence,
declined the invitation, saying that he was content
with dry bread eaten at home, and had no desire to
taste the honey that pilgrims gather by the roadside.
He sent to Ahmed a poem in which he
loaded his name with extravagant praise. “On
Persian soil,” he declared, “the bud of joy has
never blown for me. How excellent is the Tigris
of Baghdad and the perfumed wine! Oh wind of
the dawn, bring unto me the dust from my friend’s
threshold, that Hafiz may wash bright with it the
eyes of his heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once only did he comply with the invitations of
foreign kings, and his experience on that occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>was far from encouraging. He visited Shah Yahya,
Shah Shudja’s brother, at Yezd, but the reward
which he received was not commensurate with his
expectations. “Long life to thee and thy heart’s
desire, oh Cup-bearer of Djem’s court!” he writes—and
the context shows that the allusion is to Shah
Yahya—“though while I dwelt with thee my cup
was never filled with wine.” Moreover, a devoted
lover of Shiraz, Hafiz was overcome with homesickness
when he was absent from his native town.
“Why,” he says in a pathetic little poem written
while he was at Yezd—“Why should I not return
to mine own home? Why should I not lay my dust
in the street of mine own beloved? My bosom
cannot endure the sorrows of exile; let me return
to mine own city, let me be master of my heart’s
desire.” It was after this luckless visit to Shah
Yahya that he is said to have remarked, “It seems
that Fortune did not intend kings to be wise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He never again gathered the honey of the roads of
pilgrimage. Once, indeed, in answer to the pressing
invitation of Shah Mahmud Purabi, Sultan of Bengal,
he set forth for India; but a series of accidents
befell him, he lost heart and returned home again.
The story is told in a note to Poem <a href='#XXI'>XXI</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Sultan of Hormuz he received many
favours, though he refused to visit him and his pearl
fisheries in the Persian Gulf. He compares this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Sultan with Shah Yahya, much to the disadvantage
of the latter, saying that the King who had never
seen him had filled his mouth with pearls, whereas
Shah Yahya, to whose court he had journeyed, had
sent him empty away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shah Shudja was not the only member of the
house of Muzaffar who protected Hafiz; the warrior
prince Mansur was his staunch friend. He appears
to have been absent from Shiraz at the time of
Mansur’s accession—perhaps he had accompanied
Timur’s retreating army. “The wind has brought
me word,” he cries, “that the day of sorrow is overpast;
I will return to Shiraz through the favour of
my friend. On the banners of the Conqueror (<em>i.e.</em>
Mansur, of whose name this is the meaning) Hafiz
is borne up into heaven; fleeing for refuge, his
destiny has set him upon the steps of a throne.”
Mansur held the poet in high esteem. There is a
tradition that when he appointed one of his sons
governor over a province, the young man asked his
father to give him his vizir, Jelaleddin, as a counsellor,
and Hafiz as a teacher. “What!” replied
Mansur, “wouldst thou be King even in thy father’s
lifetime, that thou demandest of him the two wisest
men in his realm?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hafiz by this time had grown old. Youth had
been very pleasant; not without a sigh the grey-haired
man relinquished it. “Ah, why has my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>black hair turned white!” he laments, and tries to
warm his old blood with the wine of former days.
“Yesterday at dawn I came upon one or two glasses
of wine—as sweet as the lip of the Cup-bearer they
seemed to my palate. And then, my brain afire, I
desired to return to my mistress, Youth, but between
us a divorce had been pronounced.” And again:
“Last night Hafiz strayed into the tavern, and it
seemed to him that Youth, his mistress, had come
back, and that love and madness had returned to
his old head.” “Gieb meine Jugend mir zurück!”
Other poets besides Hafiz have sung to the same
tune. Whether or no he lived to witness the overthrow
of the race that had sheltered him, he foresaw
the troubles that were coming upon it and upon
his beloved Shiraz. There is a short poem full of
foreboding which is said to have been written after
the entry of Timur: “What tumult I see beneath
the moon’s orbit, every quarter of the earth is full
of evil and wickedness! There is strife among our
daughters, and among our mothers contention, and
the father is evilly disposed towards his son. Only
the foolish are drinking sherbet of rose-water and
sugar; the wise are nourished upon their own heart’s
blood. The Arabian horse is wounded beneath the
saddle, and the ass wears a collar of gold about his
neck. Master, take the counsel of Hafiz: ‘Go and
do good!’ for I see that this maxim is worth more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>than a treasure-house of jewels.” In several verses
he congratulates Mansur upon a victory and a fortunate
return to Shiraz, which may perhaps refer
to the re-establishment of the Muzaffaride line after
Timur’s departure. “Give me the cup,” he says in
one of these, “for the airs of youth blow through
my old head, so glad am I to see the King’s face
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The date of his death is variously given as 1388,
1389, 1391, and 1394, but it seems unlikely that he
should have been alive as late as 1394. 1389 is
the year given in a couplet by an unknown author,
which is inscribed upon his tomb: “If thou wouldst
know when he sought a home in the dust of Mosalla,
seek his date in the dust of Mosalla.” The
letters of the Persian words Khak-i-Mosalla, dust
of Mosalla, give the number 791, that is 1389 of
our era. He lies in the garden of Mosalla outside
Shiraz, a garden the praises of which he was never
tired of singing, and on the banks of the Ruknabad,
where he had so often rested under the shade of
cypress-trees. When, some sixty years after the
poet’s death, Sultan Baber conquered Shiraz, he
erected a monument over the tomb of Hafiz. An
oblong block of stone on which are carved two songs
from the Divan, marks the grave. At the head of
it is inscribed a sentence in Arabic: “God is the
enduring, and all else passes away.” The garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>contains the tombs of many devout Persians who
have desired to rest in the sacred earth which holds
the bones of the poet, and his prophecy that his
grave should become a place of pilgrimage for all
the drunkards of the world has been to a great
extent fulfilled. A very ancient cypress, said to
be of Hafiz’s own planting, stood for many hundreds
of years at the head of his grave, and “cast
its shadow o’er the dust of his desire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not often that a teacher and the favourite
of princes enjoys unmixed popularity, especially
when his criticisms of such as disagree with him
are as harsh and as often repeated as are those of
Hafiz; nor does he seem to have been an exception
to the general rule. Moreover, his own conduct
gave his enemies sufficient grounds for complaint.
His biographers, as biographers will, take a rosy
view of his life. Daulat Shah, for instance, states
that “he turned always to the company of dervishes
and of wise men, and sometimes he attained
also to the society of princes; a friend of persons
of eminent virtue and perfection, and of noble
youths.” But such accounts as these are not entirely
borne out by other traditions, and his poems
do not seem to the unbiased reader to be the
works of a man of ascetic temperament. With all
due deference to Daulat Shah, I would submit that
Abu Ishac, Shah Shudja, and Shah Mansur were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>none of them persons of eminent virtue; indeed, it
is difficult to imagine that a friend and panegyrist
of theirs could have renounced all the joys of life.
His enemies went so far as to accuse him of heresy
and even of atheism, and so strong was popular
feeling against him that, on his death, it was debated
whether his body might be given the rites
of burial. The question was only settled by consulting
his poems, which, on being taken at haphazard,
opened upon the following verse: “Fear
not to follow with pious feet the corpse of Hafiz,
for though he was drowned in the ocean of sin, he
may find a place in paradise.” It is a fortunate
age which will allow a man’s writings to stand his
doubtful reputation in such good stead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hafiz was married and he had a son. He laments
the death of both wife and child in two poems
which are translated in this volume. In spite of
all the favours which he received from the great
men of his day, he is said to have died poor.</p>

<p class='c009'>During his lifetime he was too busy “teaching
and composing philosophical treatises,” says his
great Turkish editor, Sudi, “to gather together his
songs; he used to recite them in his school, expressing
a wish that these pearls might be strung
together for the adornment of his contemporaries.”
This was done after his death by his pupil Sayyed
Kasim el Anwar, and the Divan of Hafiz is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of the most popular books in the Persian language.
From India to Constantinople his songs are sung
and repeated by all who speak the Persian tongue,
and the number of his European translators shows
that his uncle’s curse has a special and peculiar
influence in Western countries. Like the Æneid,
the Divan of Hafiz is consulted as a guide to future
action. There are several stories of famous men
who have had recourse to these <i><span lang="la">Sortes Hafizianæ</span></i>.
It is related that Nadir Shah took counsel from
Hafiz’s book when he was meditating an expedition
against Tauris, and opened it at the following
verse: “Irak and Fars thou hast conquered with
thy songs, oh Hafiz; now it is the turn of Baghdad
and the appointed hour of Tabriz.” Nadir Shah
took this as an encouragement to fresh conquest,
and went on his way rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not only as a maker of exquisite verse but
also as a philosopher that Hafiz has gained so wide
an esteem in the East. No European who reads his
Divan but will be taken captive by the delicious
music of his songs, the delicate rhythms, the beat of
the refrain, and the charming imagery. Some of them
are instinct with the very spirit of youth and love
and joy, some have a nobler humanity and cry out
across the ages with a voice pitifully like our own;
and yet few of us will turn to Hafiz for wisdom and
comfort, or choose him as a guide. It is the interminable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the hopeless mysticism, the playing with
words that say one thing and mean something totally
different, the vagueness of a philosophy that dares
not speak out, which repels the European just as
much as it attracts the Oriental mind. “Give us a
working theory,” we demand. “Build us imaginary
mansions where our souls, fugitives from the actual,
may dream themselves away”—that, it seems to me,
is what the Persian asks of his teacher.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hafiz belonged to the great sect from which so
many of the most famous among Persian writers
have sprung. Like Sa’di and Jami and Jelaleddin
Rumi and a score of others, he was a Sufi. The
history of Sufiism has yet to be written, the sources
from which it arose are uncertain, and that it should
have found a home in Mahommadanism, the least
mystical of all religions, is still unexplained. Some
have supposed that Sufiism was imported from India
after the time of Mahommad; some that it was a
development of the doctrines of Zoroaster which the
Prophet’s successors silenced but did not destroy.
In reply to the first theory it has been objected that
there is no historic proof of relations between India
and Mahommadan countries after the Mahommadan
era and before the rise of Sufiism, by which the
doctrines of the Indian mystics could have been propagated;
and as for the second, it seems improbable
that Sufiism, of which the essential doctrine is unity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>could have borrowed much from a religion as sharply
opposed to it as that of Zoroaster, whose creed is
founded upon a dualism. A third theory is that the
origins of Sufiism are to be looked for in the philosophy
of the Greeks, strangely distorted by the
Eastern mind, and in the influence of Christianity;
but though the works of Plato are frequently quoted
by mystical writers, and though it seems certain that
they owe something both to the Neo-Platonic school
of Alexandria and to the Christian religion, this
would not be enough to account for the great perversion
of Mahommad’s teaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>Baron Sylvestre de Sacy suggested the following
explanation of the matter.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The second century of
the Hejira was a time of fermentation and of the
rise of sects. This was due in the first place to the
introduction of Greek philosophy, and in the second
to the rivalry between the partisans of Ali and those
of the Ommiad and Abbaside Khalifs. It was among
the followers of Ali that the doctrines of the union
of God and man, the infusion of the Divinity in the
imams, and the allegorical interpretation of religious
ceremonies grew up. Daulat Shah in his Biography
of the Persian Poets traces back mysticism as far
as to Ali himself, though it is probable that he is
imputing to the son-in-law of the Prophet beliefs
which were of a somewhat later date. By force of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>circumstances the Alides were placed in opposition to
the ruling Khalifs, and were obliged to find a justification
for their attitude, and for submitting to
the observances enjoined by those whom they refused
to recognise as true representatives of Mahommad.
They read the Koran by the light of a new creed, and
interpreted it in a manner far different from that
intended by its author. From the moment when
the division between Shi’ite and Sunni sprang into
being, the Shi’ites, or followers of Ali, made the
eastern provinces of the Khalifate their stronghold.
It is not unreasonable to suppose that a mysticism,
in every way contrary to the true spirit of the Koran,
made in those provinces nearest to India so rapid a
progress, because, before the conquest of Persia by
the Arabs, Indian mysticism had already struck root
there. That is to say, that there had grown up,
side by side with Zoroastrianism, a mysticism eminently
congenial to the peculiar temper of the
Persian mind—so congenial, indeed, that it was not
stamped out by the Arab conquerors, but insinuated
itself into the stern and practical creed which they
forced upon a nation of dreamers and metaphysicians.
The author of the Dabistan, a book written in the
seventeenth century, containing the description of
twelve different faiths, relates that there existed in
Persia a sect belonging to the Yekaneh Bina, of those
whose eyes are fixed upon One alone: “They say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>that the world has no external or tangible existence;
all that is, is God, and beyond him there is nothing.
The intelligences and the souls of men, the angels,
the heavens, the stars, the elements, and the three
kingdoms of nature exist only in the mind of God
and have no existence beyond.” “If this Indian
doctrine of Maya, or Illusion,” adds M. de Sacy,
“had been transferred to Persia, there is every reason
to believe that mysticism, grounded on the doctrine
that all things are an emanation from God and that
unto him they shall return, may be traced to the
same source.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The keynote of Sufiism is the union, the identification
of God and man. It is a doctrine which lies
at the root of all spiritual religions, but pushed too
far it leads to pantheism, quietism, and eventually
to nihilism. The highest good to which the Sufis
can attain, is the annihilation of the actual—to
forget that they have a separate existence, and to
lose themselves in the Divinity as a drop of water
is lost in the ocean.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> In order to obtain this end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>they recommend ascetic living and solitude; but they
do not carry asceticism to the absurd extremes enjoined
by the Indian mystics, nor do they approve
of artificial aids for the subduing of consciousness,
such as opium, or hashish, or the wild physical
exertions of the dancing dervishes. The drunkenness
of the Sufi poets, say their interpreters, is
nothing but an ecstatic frame of mind, in which the
spirit is intoxicated with the contemplation of God
just as the body is intoxicated with wine. According
to the Dabistan there are four stages in the
manifestation of the Divinity: in the first the mystic
sees God in the form of a corporal being; in the
second he sees him in the form of one of his attributes
of action, as the Maker or the Preserver of
the world; in the third he appears in the form of
an attribute which exists in his very essence, as
knowledge or life; in the fourth the mystic is no
longer conscious of his own existence. To the last
he can hope to attain but seldom.</p>

<p class='c009'>This losing of the soul in God is only a return
(and here we come near to such Platonic doctrines
as those embodied in the Phædrus) to the conditions
which existed before birth into the world. Just as
in the Dialogue the immortal steed which is harnessed
to the chariot of the soul, longs to return
to the plain of birth, and to see again the true
justice, beauty, and wisdom of which it has retained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>an imperfect recollection, so the soul of the Sufi
longs to return to God, from whom it has been
separated by the mortal veil of the body. But
this reunion is pushed much further by the Eastern
philosophers than by Plato; it implies, according
to them, the complete annihilation of distinct personality,
corresponding to the conditions, quite unlike
those described by the Platonic Socrates, which
they believe to have existed before birth. There is
nothing which is not from God and a part of God.
In himself he contains both being and not being;
when he chooses he casts his reflection upon the
void, and that reflection is the universe. There is
a fine passage in Jami’s Yusuf and Zuleikha in
which he sets forth this doctrine of the creation.
“Thou art but the glass,” the poet concludes, “his
is the face reflected in the mirror; nay, if thou
lookest steadfastly, thou shalt see that he is the
mirror also.” In a parable, Jami illustrates the
universal presence of God, and the blind searching
of man for that by which he is surrounded on
every side. There was a frog which sat upon the
shores of the ocean, and ceaselessly day and night
he sang its praise. “As far as mine eyes can see,”
he said, “I behold nothing but thy boundless surface.”
Some fish swimming in the shallow water
heard the frog’s song, and were filled with a desire
to find that wonderful ocean of which he spoke, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>go where they would they could not discover it.
At last, in the course of their search, they fell into
a fisherman’s net, and as soon as they were drawn
out of the water they saw beneath them the ocean
for which they had been seeking. With a leap they
returned into it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story of the creation as told in the Koran
it is impossible for the Sufis to accept; they are
bound to give an outward adhesion to it, but in
their hearts they treat it as an allegory. The world
is posterior to God only in the nature of its existence
and not in time: the Sufis were not far from
the doctrine of the eternity of matter, from which
they were only withheld by the necessity of conforming
with the teaching of the Koran. They
content themselves with saying that the world
came into existence when it pleased God to manifest
himself beyond himself, and will cease when it
shall please him to return into himself again. It
is more difficult to dispose of the resurrection of
the body, which is constantly insisted upon by
Mahommad. That the soul, when it has at last
attained to complete union with God, should be
obliged to return to the prison from whence it has
escaped at death, is entirely repugnant to all Sufis;
nor can they explain satisfactorily the divergence of
their opinions from those of the Prophet.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has been well said that all religious teachers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>who have honestly tried to construct a working
formula, have found that one of their greatest difficulties
lay in reconciling the all-powerfulness of God
with man’s consciousness of his will being free; for
on the one hand it is impossible to conceive a God
worth the name who shall be less than omnipotent
and omniscient, and on the other it is essential to
lay upon man some responsibility for his actions.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
Mahommad more especially, as Count Gobineau
points out in his excellent little book,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a> found himself
confronted with this difficulty, since his primary
object was to exalt the divine personality, and to
lift it out of the pantheism into which it had fallen
among the pre-Islamitic Arabs; but if he did not
succeed in indicating a satisfactory way out of the
dilemma, it is at least unjust to accuse him of
having failed to recognise it. He insisted that man
is responsible for his own salvation: “Whosoever
chooseth the life to come, their desire shall be
acceptable unto God.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> There is a tradition that
when some of his disciples were disputing over predestination,
he said to them: “Why do you not
imitate Omar? For when one came to him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>asked him, ‘What is predestination?’ he answered,
‘It is a deep sea.’ And a second time he replied,
‘It is a dark road.’ And a third time, ‘It is a
secret which I will not declare since God has seen
fit to conceal it.’” The Sufis were obliged to
abandon free will: it was impossible to attach any
responsibility to the reflection in the mirror. But
here, again, they did not venture to give expression
to their real opinions, and their statements are
therefore both confused and contradictory. “A
man may say,” remarks the author of the Dabistan,
“that his actions are his own, and with equal
truth that they are God’s.” In the Gulshen-i-Raz,
a poem written in the year 1317, and therefore
contemporary with Hafiz, it is distinctly laid down
that God will take men’s actions into account:
“After that moment (<em>i.e.</em> the Day of Judgment) he
will question them concerning good and evil.” But
such expressions as these are in direct opposition
to the rest of Sufi teaching. There is neither good
nor evil, since both alike flow from God, from whom
all flows. Some go so far as to prefer Pharaoh to
Moses, Nimrod to Abraham, because they say that
though Pharaoh and Nimrod were in apparent
revolt against the Divinity, in reality they knew
their own nothingness and accepted the part that
the divine wisdom had imposed upon them. There
is neither reward nor punishment; Paradise is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>beauty, Hell the glory of God, and when it is
said that those in Hell are wretched, it is meant
that the dwellers in Heaven would be wretched in
their place.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> And finally, there is no distinction
between God and man; the soul is but an emanation
from God, and a man is therefore justified
in saying with the fanatic Hallaj, “I am God.”
Though Hallaj paid with his life for venturing to
give voice to his opinion, he was only repeating
aloud what all Sufis believe to be true.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “It is
permitted to a tree to say, ‘I am God,’” writes
the author of the Gulshen-i-Raz (the allusion is
to the burning bush that spoke to Moses); “why
then may not a man say it?” And again: “In God
there is no distinction of quality; in his divine
majesty I, thou, and we shall not be found. I,
thou, we, and he bear the same meaning, for in
unity there is no division. Every man who has
annihilated the body and is entirely separated from
himself, hears within his heart a voice that crieth,
‘I am God.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>The conception of the union and interdependence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of all things divine and human is far older than Sufi
thought. It goes back to the earliest Indian teaching,
and Professor Deussen, in his book on Metaphysics,
has pointed out the conclusion which is
drawn from it in the Veda. “The gospels,” he says,
“fix quite correctly as the highest law of morality,
Love thy neighbour as thyself. But why should I
do so, since by the order of nature I feel pain and
pleasure only in myself, not in my neighbour? The
answer is not in the Bible (this venerable book
being not yet quite free from Semitic realism), but
it is in the Veda: You shall love your neighbour
as yourselves because you <em>are</em> your neighbour; a
mere illusion makes you believe that your neighbour
is something different from yourselves. Or in the
words of the Bhagaradgitah: He who knows himself
in everything and everything in himself, will not
injure himself by himself. This is the sum and
tenor of all morality, and this is the standpoint of
a man knowing himself a Brahman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sufis were forced to pay an exaggerated deference
to the Prophet and to Ali in order to keep
on good terms with the orthodox, but since they
believed God to be the source of all creeds they
could not reasonably place one above another; nay
more, since they taught that any man who practised
a particular religion had failed to free himself from
duality and to reach perfect union with God, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>must have held Mahommadanism in like contempt
with all other faiths. “When thou and I remain
not (when man is completely united with God),
what matters the Ka’ba and the Synagogue and the
Monastery?”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a> That is, what difference is there
between the religion of Mahommadan, Jew, and
Christian? “One night,” says Ferideddin Attar in
a beautiful allegory, “the angel Gabriel was seated
on the branches of a tree in the Garden of Paradise,
and he heard God pronounce a word of assent. ‘At
this moment,’ thought the angel, ‘some man is invoking
God. I know not who he is; but this I
know, that he must be a notable servant of the
Lord, one whose soul is dead to evil and whose
spirit lives.’ Then Gabriel desired to know who
this man could be, but in the seven zones he found
him not. He traversed the land and the sea and
found him not in mountain or in plain. Therefore
he hastened back to the presence of God, and again
he heard him give a favourable answer to the same
prayers. Again he set forth and sought through
the world, yet he saw not the servant of God. ‘Oh
Lord,’ he cried, ‘show me the path that leads to
him upon whom thy favours fall!’ ‘Go to the
Land of Rome,’ God answered, ‘and in a certain
monastery thou shalt find him.’ Thither fled
Gabriel, and found him whom he sought, and lo!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>he was worshipping an idol. When he returned,
Gabriel opened his lips and said, ‘Oh Master,
draw aside for me the veil from this secret: why
fulfillest thou the prayers of one who invokes an
idol in a monastery?’ And God replied, ‘His
spirit is darkened and he knows not that he has
missed the way; but since he errs from ignorance,
I pardon his fault: my mercy is extended to him,
and I allow him to enter into the highest place.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the language of religious mysticism, God is
not only the Creator and Ruler of the world, he is
also the Essentially Beautiful and the True Beloved.
Love, of which the divine being is at once the source
and the object, plays a large part in Sufi writings,
a part which it is difficult, and sometimes unwise,
to distinguish from an exaggerated expression of
the human affections. Jami describes Pure Being,
before it had been manifested in Creation, “singing
of love unto itself in a wordless melody,”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and in
the same strain Hafiz sings of “the Imperial Beauty
which is for ever playing the game of love with
itself.” Like the echo of a Greek voice falls
Jami’s doctrine of human love: “Avert not thy
face from an earthly beloved, since even this may
serve to raise thee to the love of the True.” It
is almost possible to read in the Persian poem the
words of the wise Diotima to Socrates: “He who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>has been instructed thus far in the things of love,
and has learnt to see the Beautiful in true order
and succession, when he comes towards the end will
suddenly perceive a nature of wonderful beauty, not
growing or decaying, waxing or waning&#160;... he
who, under the influence of true love, rising upward
from these things begins to see that beauty, is not
far from the end.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sufis had no difficulty in finding in the
Koran texts in support of their teaching. When
Mahommad exclaims, “There are times when neither
cherubim nor prophet are equal unto me!” the
Sufis declare that he alludes to moments of ecstatic
union with God; and his account of the victory of
Bedr—“Thou didst not slay them, but God slew
them, and thou didst not shoot when thou didst
shoot, but God shot”—they take as a proof of the
Prophet’s belief in the essential oneness of God and
man.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> The whole book is twisted after this fashion
into agreement with their views.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beautiful and spiritual as some of these doctrines
are, they can hardly be said to form an adequate
guide to conduct. The Sufis, however, are regarded
in the East as men leading a virtuous and pure life.
Even the etymology of their name points to the same
conclusion: Sufi comes from an Arabic word signifying
wool, and indicates that they were accustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to clothe themselves in simple woollen garments.
They occupy in the East much the same position
that Madame Guyon and the Jansenists occupied
in the West, and they teach the same doctrine of
quietism, which, while it lends to its followers the
virtues of exaggerated submission, saps the root of
a faith that is manifested in works. So far as the
Sufis are striving earnestly after union with God,
they are saved from the logical consequences of
their doctrines: “Their ear is strained to catch
the sounds of the lute, their eyes are fixed upon
the cup, their bosoms are filled with the desire of
this world and of the world to come.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a> And in
the same spirit Hafiz sings: “Though the wind of
discord shake the two worlds, mine eyes are fixed
upon the road from whence cometh my Friend.”
The idealism of the Sufis led them to deny the
morality of all actions, but they restricted the
consequences of their principles to the adepts who
had attained to perfect union with God, and
even for them the moments of ecstasy are few.
Most Sufis are good and religious men, holding
it their duty to conform outwardly, and no discredit
to use all artifices to conceal from the
orthodox the beliefs which they cherish in their
heart, but holding also that the practice of the
Mahommadan religion, to the rites of which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>have attached symbolic meanings, is the only way to
the perfection to which they aspire. Nevertheless,
Count Gobineau is of opinion that quietism is the
great curse of the East. “The dominant characteristic
of Sufiism,” he says, “is to unite by a weak
chain of doctrine, ideas the significance of which is
very different, so different that there is in reality
but one connecting link between them, and that link
is a quietism adapted to them all, a passive disposition
of spirit which surrounds with a nimbus
of inert sentiment all conceptions of God, of man,
and of the universe. It is this quietism, and not
Islam, which is the running sore of all Oriental
countries.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Unfortunately, as he points out, the conditions
of Oriental life are such as to enforce rather than
to control a disposition to mysticism. The poets
found ready to their hand a mass of vague and
beautiful thought eminently suited to imaginative
treatment; whether they believed in it or not they
used it, and thereby popularised it, delighting, as
only an Oriental can, in the necessity of veiling it
with exquisite symbolism, and throwing round it
a cloud of charming phrases. These phrases caught
and held the Oriental ear; and the Oriental mind
is faithful to a formula once accepted. Moreover,
when a man looked about him and saw the vicissitudes
of mortal existence—nowhere more marked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>than in the East—how conqueror succeeded conqueror
and empire empire, how the humble was
exalted and the mighty thrown from his seat, how
swift was the vengeance of God in sweeping pestilence
and resistless famine, and how unsparing the
forces of nature, he turned to a philosophy which
taught that all earthly things were alike vain—virtue
and patriotism and the love of wife and
child, power and beauty and the bold part played
in a hopeless fight; he remembered what he had
learnt from poets and story-tellers—“Behold the
world is as the shadow of a cloud and a dream of
the night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How far the Divan of Hafiz can be said to
embody these doctrines, each reader must decide
for himself, and each will probably arrive at a
different conclusion. Between the judgment of
Jami, that Hafiz was undoubtedly an eminent Sufi,
and that of Von Hammer, who, playing upon his
names, declared that the Sun of the Faith gave but
an uncertain light, and the Interpreter of Secrets
interpreted only the language of pleasure—between
these two there is a wide field for differences of
opinion. For my part, I cannot agree entirely
either with Jami or with Von Hammer. Partly,
perhaps, owing to the wise guidance of Sheikh
Mahmud Attar, partly to a natural freedom of
spirit, Hafiz seems to me to rise above the narrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>views of his co-religionists, and to look upon the
world from a wider standpoint. The asceticism
of Sufi and orthodox he alike condemns: “The
ascetic is the serpent of the age!” he cries. I
think it was not only to curry favour with a king
that he welcomed the accession of Shah Shudja,
nor was it only to disarm the criticism of stricter
Mohammadans that he described himself as a weary
seeker after wisdom, praying God to show him
some guiding light by which he might direct
his steps. Of the two conclusions that are commonly
drawn from the statement that to-morrow
we die, Hafiz accepted neither unmodified by the
other. “Eat and drink,” seemed to him a poor
solution of the mysterious purpose of human life,
and an unsatisfactory sign-post to happiness; “the
abode of pleasure,” he says, “was never reached
except through pain.” On the other hand, he was
equally unwilling to despise the good things of this
world. “The Garden of Paradise may be pleasant,
but forget not the shade of the willow-tree and the
fair margin of the fruitful field.” “Now, now while
the rose is with us, sing her praise; now, while we
are here to listen, Minstrel, strike the lute! for the
burden of all thy songs has been that the present is
all too short, and already the unknown future is upon
us.” He, too, would have us cut down far reaching
hope to the limit of our little day, though he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>cherished in his heart a more or less elusive conviction
that he should find the fire of love burning still,
and with a purer flame, behind the veil which his
eyes could not pierce.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be that as it may, one who sings the cool rush of
the wind of dawn, the scarlet cup of the tulip uplifted
in solitary places, the fleeting shadows of the
clouds, and the praise of gardens and fountains and
fruitful fields, was not likely to forget that even if
the world is no more than an intangible reflection
of its Creator, the reflection of eternal beauty is in
itself worthy to be admired. I wish I could believe
that such innocent delights as these, and a wholehearted
desire for truth, had been enough for our
poet, but I have a shrewd suspicion that the Cup-bearer
brought him a wine other than that of
divine knowledge, and that his mistress is considerably
more than an allegorical figure. How ever
willing we may be to submit to the wise men of
the East when they tell us that the revelry of the
poems is always a spiritual exaltation, it must be
admitted that the words of the poet carry a different
conviction to Western ears. There is undoubtedly
a note of sincerity in his praise of love and wine
and boon-companionship, and I am inclined to
think that Hafiz was one of those who, like Omar
Khayyam, were wont to throw the garment of repentance
annually into the fire of Spring. It must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>remembered that the morality of his day was not
that of our own, and that the manners of the East
resemble but vaguely those of the West; and though
as a religious teacher Hafiz would have been better
advised if he had less frequently loosened the rein
of his desires, I doubt whether his songs would have
rung for us with the same passionate force. After
all, the poems of St. Francis of Assisi are not much
read nowadays. Nevertheless, the reader misses
a sense of restraint both in the matter and in
the manner of the Divan. To many Persians, Hafiz
occupies the place that is filled by Shakespeare in
the minds of many Englishmen. It may be a national
prejudice, but I cannot bring myself to believe that
the mental food supplied by the Oriental is as good as
the other. But, then, our appetites are not the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tendency in dealing with a mystical poet is
to read into him so-called deeper meanings, even
when the simple meaning is clear enough and sufficient
in itself. Hafiz is one of those who has suffered
from this process; it has removed him, in great
measure, from the touch of human sympathies which
are, when all is said and done, a poet’s true kingdom.
Of a different age, a different race, and a different
civilisation from ours, there are yet snatches in his
songs of that melody of human life which is everywhere
the same. When he cries, “My beloved is
gone and I had not even bidden him farewell!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>his words are as poignant now as they were five
centuries ago, and they could gain nothing from a
mystical interpretation. As simple and as touching
is his lament for his son: “Alas! he found it easy
to depart, but unto me he left the harder pilgrimage.”
And for his wife: “Then said my heart, I
will rest me in this city which is illumined by her
presence; already her feet were bent upon a longer
journey, but my poor heart knew it not.” Not
Shakespeare himself has found a more passionate
image for love than: “Open my grave when I am
dead, and thou shalt see a cloud of smoke rising
out from it; then shalt thou know that the fire still
burns in my dead heart—yea, it has set my very
winding-sheet alight.” Or: “If the scent of her
hair were to blow across my dust when I had been
dead a hundred years, my mouldering bones would
rise and come dancing out of the tomb.” And he
knows of what he writes when he says, “I have
estimated the influence of Reason upon Love and
found that it is like that of a raindrop upon the
ocean, which makes one little mark upon the water’s
face and disappears.” These are the utterances of
a great poet, the imaginative interpreter of the
heart of man; they are not of one age, or of another,
but for all time. Fitz-Gerald knew it when he
declared that Hafiz rang true. “Hafiz is the most
Persian of the Persians,” he says. “He is the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>representative of their character, whether his Saki
and wine be real or mystical. Their religion and
philosophy is soon seen through, and always seems
to me cuckooed over like a borrowed thing, which
people once having got do not know how to parade
enough. To be sure their roses and nightingales
are repeated often enough. But Hafiz and old
Omar Khayyam ring like true metal.” The criticism
and the praise seem to me both just and delicate.</p>

<p class='c009'>To a certain extent it may be said that the
Sufiism of Hafiz is partly due to the natural leaning
of the Oriental poet towards a picturesque diction
(for all poetry must, to satisfy Eastern readers,
be couched in a veiled and enigmatic speech),<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and has partly been read into the Divan by later
ages. But this is not all. With Shah Shudja,
I would accuse him of mixing up inextricably wine
and love and Sufi teaching, and perhaps more
besides. To some at least of the innumerable
difficulties which assail every man who turns a
thoughtful eye upon life and its conditions, Hafiz
seems to have accepted the solution presented to
him by Sufiism. He understood and sympathised
with the bold heresy of Hallaj, “though fools
whom God hath not uplifted know not the meaning
of him who said, I am God.” Sometimes we find
him enunciating one of the abstruser of the Sufi
doctrines: “How shall I say that existence is mine
when I have no knowledge of myself, or how that
I exist not when mine eyes are fixed upon Him?”—a
man, that is, can lay claim to no individual
existence; all that he knows is that he is a part of
the eternally existing. Or, again, he declares that
his words are metaphorical, and should receive the
full Sufi interpretation, as in the following couplet:
“Boon companion, minstrel, and cup-bearer, all
these are but names for Him; the image of water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and clay (man) is an illusion upon the road of life.”
But he handles Sufiism in a broad and noble manner,
which links it on to the highest codes of morality
accepted among the civilised races of mankind.
“For all eternity the perfume of love comes not to
him who has not swept with his cheek the dust from
the tavern threshold”—“Blessed are the poor in
spirit,” Hafiz is saying in phraseology suited to the
ears of those whom he addressed. “If thou desire
the jewelled cup of ruby wine,” he continues (and it
is of the hunger and thirst after wisdom that he
speaks), “ah, many tears shall thine eyes thread
upon thine eyelashes!” He did not forget that
“the Sufi gold is not always without alloy,” and
he was not one of those who believe that they have
discovered the answer to all human demands when
their own heart is satisfied. “Since thou canst
never leave the palace of thyself,” he warns us, “how
canst thou hope to reach the village of truth.”
The song that filled his soul with gladness might
strike on other ears to a different measure; and
“where is the music to which both the drunk and
the sober can dance?” He was, indeed, profoundly
sceptical as to the infallibility of any creed, judging
men not by the practice, but by the spirit that
lay beneath it: “None shall die whose heart has
lived with the life love breathed into it; but when
the day of reckoning comes, I fancy that the Sheikh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>will find that he has gained as little by his abstinence
as I by my feasting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sufiism apart, an undercurrent of mysticism runs
through the poems which it is impossible to explain
away. If we should attempt to ignore it, many of
the odes would have no meaning at all, and most
of them would lose a good half of their interest.
Take, for instance, such verses as the following:
“Heart and soul are fixed upon the desire of the
Beloved: this at least <em>is</em>, for if not, heart and soul
are nought. Fate is that which comes to the brink
without the heart’s blood; if not, all thy striving
after the Garden of Paradise is nought. Throw
thyself not at the foot of its sacred trees hoping
for their shade; dost thou not see, oh cypress,
that even these are nought unto thee?” Hafiz is
engaged in that terrible weighing of possibilities
which every man who thinks must know: “Surely
the soul which is filled with the desire of God
must have some quality which shall be stronger than
death? But if this were not so&#160;... then indeed
the soul itself is nought. Surely Fate is like an
empty bowl standing upon the edge of the river of
life? But if the bowl had been already filled with
blood&#160;... then all your striving to reach the
Garden of Paradise shall avail you nothing. For
do you not see, you who dare to acknowledge the
truth, that you cannot battle against an appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Destiny, and however grateful may be the shade of
the holy trees, they could afford you no protection.”
Nor can I believe that it is an earthly love of whom
he speaks when he says, “Since the Beloved has
veiled his face, how comes it that his lovers are
reciting his beauties? They can only tell what
they imagine to be there.” We are all engaged in
telling each other—only what we imagine to be there.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a curious coincidence (if it be nothing more)
that at the time when mystical poetry was taking
a recognised place in the literature of Persia and
of India, it was also springing into existence in the
West. The songs of the Troubadours were avowedly
intended to convey a meaning deeper than that
which lay upon the surface; the Romance of the
Rose comes nearer than any other Western allegory
to a full-fledged mysticism worthy of an Oriental
poet. St. Francis addresses his Redeemer in terms
not very different from those used by Hafiz to
express his longing after divine wisdom, and the
Beatrice, perhaps of the <i><span lang="fr">Vita Nuova</span></i>, certainly of
the Divine Comedy, is no less intangible than the
allegorical mistress (when she is allegorical) of the
Persian.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hafiz and Dante, it is interesting to note, were
almost contemporaries. At the time when Dante
was climbing Can Grande’s weary stair, Hafiz was
opening his eyes upon a yet more tumultuous world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Both were driven by the confusion around them to
look for some solid platform on which to build a
theory of existence, but Dante found it in that
strenuous personal faith which is for ever impossible
to minds of the temper of that of Hafiz. Moreover,
the mysticism of Dante stands with its feet planted
firmly upon the earth: man and his deeds might
be fleeting, but they laid so strong a hold upon the
poet’s imagination that he welded them into a
stepping-stone to that which shall not pass away.
His own life was spent in a ceaseless political
activity; for all his visionary journeys through
heaven and hell, Dante lived as keenly as any of
his contemporaries. The fire still burns in the dead
heart; the fierce and tender spirit, roused by turns
to merciless condemnation and exquisite pity, still
glows with a flame removed from mortal conditions,
which the chill of death cannot extinguish as long
as men shall read and understand. Through him
his age lives. The people whom he had met, those
of whom he had only heard, the smallest incidents
of his time, the sum of all that it knew and of all
that it believed, are struck out for ever, hard and
sharp, in his vivid lines; and the fortunes of Florence,
of one little town in a little corner of the world,
loom to us, under the poet’s influence, as big and
as tragic as they seemed to that most ardent of
citizens. To Hafiz, on the contrary, modern instances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>have no value; contemporary history is too
small an episode to occupy his thoughts. During
his lifetime the city that he loved, perhaps as dearly
as Dante loved Florence, was besieged and taken
five or six times; it changed hands even more often.
It was drenched with blood by one conqueror, filled
with revelry by a second, and subjected to the hard
rule of asceticism by a third. One after another
Hafiz saw kings and princes rise into power and
vanish “like snow upon the desert’s dusty face.”
Pitiful tragedies, great rejoicings, the fall of kingdoms,
and the clash of battle—all these he must have
seen and heard. But what echo of them is there in
his poems? Almost none. An occasional allusion
which learned commentators refer to some political
event; an exaggerated effusion in praise first of one
king, then of another; the celebration of such and
such a victory and of the prowess of such and such
a royal general—just what any self-respecting court
poet would feel it incumbent upon himself to write;
and no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>But some of us will feel that the apparent indifference
of Hafiz lends to his philosophy a quality which
that of Dante does not possess. The Italian is bound
down within the limits of his own realism, his
theory of the universe is essentially of his own age,
and what to him was so acutely real is to many
of us merely a beautiful or a terrible image. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>picture that Hafiz drew represents a wider landscape,
though the immediate foreground may not be
so distinct. It is as if his mental eye, endowed with
wonderful acuteness of vision, had penetrated into
those provinces of thought which we of a later age
were destined to inhabit. We can forgive him for
leaving to us so indistinct a representation of his
own time, and of the life of the individual in it,
when we find him formulating ideas as profound as
the warning that there is no musician to whose
music both the drunk and the sober can dance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Renan has put into a few luminous sentences his
view of the mystical poets of India and Persia. “<span lang="fr">On
sait que dans ces pays</span>,” he says, “<span lang="fr">s’est développée
une vaste littérature où l’amour divin et l’amour
terrestre se croisent d’une façon souvent difficile à
démêler. L’origine de ce singulier genre de poésie
est une question qui n’est pas encore éclaircie. Dans
beaucoup de cas les sens mystiques prêtés à certaines
poésies érotiques persanes et hindoues n’ont pas
plus de réalité que les allégories du Cantique des
Cantiques. Pour Hafiz, par exemple, il semble bien
que l’explication allégorique est le plus souvent un
fruit de la fantaisie des commentateurs, ou des
précautions que les admirateurs du poète étaient
obligés de prendre pour sauver l’orthodoxie de leur
auteur favori. Puis l’imagination étant montée sur
ce thème, et les esprits étant faussés par une exégèse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>qui ne voulait voir partout qu’allégories, on en est
venu à faire des poèmes réellement à double sens.
Comme ceux de Djellaleddin Rumi, de Wali, &#38;c....
Dans l’Inde et la Perse ce genre de poésie
(érotico-mystique) est le fruit d’un extrème raffinement,
d’une imagination vive et portée au quiétisme,
d’un certain goût du mystère, et aussi, en Perse du
moins, de l’hypocrisie imposée par le fanatisme
musulman. C’est, en effet, comme réaction contre
la sécheresse de l’Islamisme que le soufisme a fait
fortune chez les musulmans non arabes. Il y faut
voir une révolte de l’esprit arien contre l’effroyante
simplicité de l’esprit sémitique, excluant par la
rigueur de sa théologie toute devotion particulière,
toute doctrine secrète, toute combinaison religieuse
vivante et variée.</span>”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Those who have written poems “<span lang="fr">réellement à
double sens</span>” are careful to insist upon the mighty
secrets that their words convey. “The things which
wise men, who are sometimes called drunkards and
sometimes seers,” says one of them, “wish to express
by the words wine, cup and cup-bearer, musician,
magian, and Christian girdle, are so many profound
mysteries which sometimes they translate by an
enigma and sometimes they reveal.” The symbols
used by each writer are more or less the same; there
is an accepted Sufi code with which the initiated are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>acquainted. “The nightingale, and none beside,
knows the full worth of the rose,” sings Hafiz, “for
many a one reads the leaf and understands not the
meaning thereof.” But though we may not all be
nightingales, we have some guide to the interpretation
of the leaf. Many of the words in the Sufi
dictionary have been expounded to the outer world.
The tavern, for instance, is the place of instruction
or worship, of which the tavern-keeper is the teacher
or priest, and the wine the spirit of divine knowledge
which is poured out for his disciples; the idol
is God; beauty is the divine perfection; shining
locks the expansion of his glory; down on the cheek
denotes the cloud of spirits that encircles his throne;
and a black mole is the point of indivisible unity.
The catalogue might be continued to any extent;
almost every word has a vague and somewhat shifting
significance in the language of mysticism, which
he who has a mind for such exercises may decipher
if he choose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hafiz is rather the forerunner than the founder
of this school of poets. It is equally unsatisfactory
to give a completely mystical or a completely material
interpretation to his songs. He wrote of the world
as he found it. In his experience pleasure and religion
were the two most important incentives to
human action; he ignored neither the one nor the
other. I am very conscious that my appreciation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the poet is that of the Western. Exactly on what
grounds he is appreciated in the East it is difficult
to determine, and what his compatriots make of his
teaching it is perhaps impossible to understand.
From our point of view, then, the sum of his philosophy
seems to be, that though there is little of
which we can be certain, that little must always be
the object of all men’s desire; each of us will set
out upon the search for it along a different road,
and if none will find his road easy to follow, each
may, if he be wise, discover compensations for his
toil by the wayside. And for the rest, “Who knows
the secret of the veil?” Like many a good and
brave man before his time and since, I think he was
content to “faintly trust the larger hope.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>NOTES</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='I' class='c012'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—The first line of this song, the opening poem in
the Divan, is borrowed from an Arabic poem by Yezid ibn
Moawiyah, the second Khalif of the Ommiad line. This prince
was held in abomination by the Persian Shi’ites, both as the
head of the Sunnis and because he was the cause of the death
of Hussein, the son of Ali, whom the Shi’ites regarded as the
rightful successor to the Khalifate. Hafiz was frequently reproached
for setting a quotation from the works of the abhorred
Yezid at the head of his book, a reproach which he is said to
have met with the reply, that it was good policy to steal from
the heretics whatsoever they possessed of worth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In this country (<em>i.e.</em> North-Eastern China) is found the best
musk in the world, and I will tell you how it is produced.
There exists in that region a kind of wild animal like a gazelle.
It has feet and tail like the gazelle’s, a stag’s hair of a very
coarse kind, but no horns. It has four tusks, two below and
two above, about three inches long, and slender in form, one
pair growing downwards and the other upwards. It is a very
pretty creature. The musk is found in this way: when the
creature has been taken, they find at the navel, between the
flesh and the skin, something like an imposthume filled with
blood, which they cut out and remove, with all the skin
attached to it; and the blood inside this imposthume is the
musk that produces that powerful perfume. There is an immense
number of these beasts in the country we are speaking
of. The flesh is very good to eat. Messer Marco brought the
dried head and feet of one of these animals to Venice with
him.”—<cite>Travels of Marco Polo.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>There is a play of meaning upon the musk which is obtained
at the cost of the deer’s life-blood and the tears of blood which
the lover weeps for his mistress.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 2.</em>—The title which Hafiz gives to the Tavern-keeper
is Pir-i-Maghan—literally, the Old Man of the Magians. The
history of this title is an epitome of the history of Persian
faiths. It indicated primarily the priest of the first of Persian
religions, that of Zoroaster. When the Mahommadans invaded
Persia, and the preachers of the Prophet supplanted the priests
of Zoroaster, their title fell into disrepute, and was degraded so
far that it came to mean only the keeper of a tavern or caravanserai.
But in this sense it gradually regained the honourable
place from which it had fallen; for the keepers of such
places of resort were, for the most part, men well acquainted
with the “ways of the road and the hostelry.” In their time
they may themselves have served travellers upon their journey;
they had heard and learnt much from the wayfarers who stopped
at their gates, and they were able to guide others upon their
journey, sending them forth refreshed and comforted in body.
And here the Sufis took up the ancient name and used it to
mean that wise old man who supplied weary travellers upon
life’s road with the spiritual draught of Sufi doctrine which
refreshes and comforts the soul.</p>

<h3 id='II' class='c011'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—This poem has been expounded to me as a description
of the poet’s quest for love. In an allegory he shows how
he looked for it in vain from that image of earthly devotion, the
nightingale; he warns men that it comes not but by humiliation
and sorrow; he questions the magic garden, but its breezes
cannot answer him; finally, he concludes that love is not that
which lies upon the lips of men, and calls upon the Cup-bearer
to silence their idle talk with the wine of divine knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 2.</em>—The Garden of Irem was planted by the mythical
King Shedad, the son of Ad, the grandson of Irem, who was
himself the son of Shem. The tribe of Ad settled in the sandy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>deserts near Aden, where Ad began the building of a great city
which his son completed. Round his palace Shedad planted a
wonderful garden which was intended to rival in beauty the
Garden of Eden. “When it was finished he set out with a great
attendance to take a view of it, but when they were come within
a day’s journey of the place they were all destroyed by a terrible
noise from heaven.... The city, they tell us, is still standing
in the deserts of Aden, being preserved by Providence as a
monument of divine justice, though it be invisible, unless very
rarely, when God permits it to be seen, a favour one Colabah
pretended to have received in the reign of the Khalif Moawiyah,
who, sending for him to know the truth of the matter, Colabah
related his whole adventure: that, as he was seeking a camel
he had lost, he found himself on a sudden at the gates of this
city, and entering it, saw not one inhabitant, at which being
terrified, he stayed no longer than to take with him some fine
stones which he showed the Khalif.”—<cite>Sale’s Koran.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>Sudi says that Hafiz composed this poem in a beautiful garden
belonging to Shah Shudja, and called by him the Bagh-i-Irem,
after Shedad’s legendary Paradise.</p>

<p class='c009'><span lang="fr">“Il y avait jadis en Perse un grand roi nommé Djem ou Djemshid.
Il régna sept cents ans; je ne saurai vous dire à quelle
date au juste, mais ‘tant qu’il régna, il n’y eut dans son empire
ni mort, ni maladie, ni vieillesse, et tous les hommes marchaient
dans la taille de jouvenceaux de quinze ans; il n’y avait ni
chaleur, ni froideur, et jamais ne se desséchaient les eaux ni les
plantes.’ Mais le pauvre Djem n’avait point la tête solide, et,
comme il faisait des immortels, il se crut Dieu et voulut être
adoré. Aussitôt, le Fari Yazdan, c’est-à-dire la gloire royale
qui vient de Dieu, l’abandonna; un serpent à trois têtes, nommé
Zohab, vint de l’Arabie et lui prit son trône; il s’enfuit dans
l’Inde et y resta chaché mille ans durant; puis un beau jour,
s’étant aventuré hors de sa retraite, il fut livré au serpent, qui
le scia en deux avec une arête de poisson. Entre autres splendeurs,
le roi Djemshid, au temps de sa splendeur, possédait une
coupe magique où il voyait tout l’univers et tout ce qui s’y passe.
Certains savants prétendent que cette coupe était le soleil qui
voit toute chose; d’autres, que c’était un globe terrestre mis au
courant, et il me souvient qu’il y a deux ans, prenant le thé dans
un café de Stamboul avec un sage d’Isfahan, nommé Habib, la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>conversation tomba de la tasse de thé à la coupe de Djemshid,
et Habib, me mettant le doigt au front, me dit: Djam-i-Djemshid,
dil-i-agah: “la coupe de Djemshid c’est le cœur de l’homme
de science.””—<em>Darmsteter</em>, “<cite>Lettres sur l’Inde</cite>.”</span></p>

<p class='c009'>A few miles from Peshawar, Darmsteter goes on to relate,
there is a dried-up pond called the Talab i Djemshid, into which
the King is said to have cast his magic cup. The head man of
the village told the French traveller that a knife had been discovered
there bearing this inscription: “This pond was dug by
me, Djemshid, five hundred years before the Hejra.” “Elle
n’a pas été retrouvée, la coupe de Djemshid,” adds Darmsteter,
“non plus que la coupe du roi de Thulé, c’est pour ça
qu’il n’y a plus parmi les hommes ni science, ni amour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Djemshid is supposed to have built Persepolis. There is a
legend that his cup was found buried in its foundations, and
that it was formed of an enormous turquoise. It is said that
he was the first to drink wine, and that he recommended it to
his subjects as a health-giving beverage. He, too, was the father
of chemistry and the possessor of the philosopher’s stone.</p>

<h3 id='III' class='c011'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—King Solomon sent the lapwing or hoopoe as his
messenger to Bilkis, Queen of Sheba. The story is told thus by
Al Ta’labi, in his Stories of the Prophets. (The lapwing had
already made a journey on his own account, and had brought
Solomon news of the great Queen, and told him that she was
not a worshipper of the true God.) “Then Solomon wrote a
letter saying: From the servant of God, Solomon, son of David,
to Bilkis, Queen of Saba, in the name of God the Merciful, the
Compassionate, peace be upon him who follows the right road.
After which he said: Behave not insolently towards me, but
come unto me humbled. And he strewed musk upon it and
sealed it with his seal. Then he said to the lapwing: Fly with
this letter and deliver it unto them, then turn away, but remain
near them and hear what answer they make. And the lapwing
took the letter and flew with it to Bilkis. And she was in the
land which is called Marib, at a distance of three days’ journey,
and she had entered into her castle, and the gates of it were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>shut. For when she slept she was wont to shut the gates and
to take the key and lay it beneath her head. So the lapwing
came unto her, and she was asleep, lying upon her back; and
he laid the letter upon her breast. Wahb ibn Manabbih says
that there was a window opposite to the sun so that the sunbeams
fell through it at dawn, and when she saw the sun she
was wont to bow down and worship it. And the lapwing went
to this window and blocked it up with his wings. And the sun
rose, but she knew it not. And she thought that the sun was
late, and stood up to look for it. Then the lapwing threw a
leaf upon her face. And they say that Bilkis took the letter
and she was able to read the writing. But when she saw the
seal she trembled and bowed down, because of the power of
Solomon that was in his seal. For she knew that the power of
him who had sent the letter was greater than hers, and she
said: Lo, here is a king whose messengers are the birds;
verily he is a mighty king.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanzas 5 and 6.</em>—The accepted explanation of these lines is
that by the glass Hafiz means his own heart, which he sends to
his mistress that she may see that her own image is reflected in
it; but I prefer here (and indeed for the whole poem) a mystical
interpretation. The heavenly voice tells him to seek for comfort
in Sufiism, and bids him look upon the mirror, for he shall
see God himself reflected in it—which is only another way of
putting the doctrine that man and God are one. The poet’s
reputation has gained him admittance into the company of the
Sufis, let him hasten to them, for they shall give him that for
which he seeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>A horse and robe is the Eastern gift of honour. Lane in one
of his notes to the “Arabian Nights” quotes a significant story
concerning these gifts: “A person chancing to look at a register
kept by one of the officers of Harun al Rashid, saw in it the
following entry: ‘400,000 pieces of gold, the price of a dress of
honour for Jafar ibn Yahya, the Vizir.’ A few days after he saw
beneath this written: ‘Ten kerits, the price of naphtha and reeds
for burning the body of Jafar ibn Yahya.’ (The kerit of Baghdad
was worth a twentieth part of a gold piece.)</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Verse 3.</em>—The Persians describe the dimple in the chin of

into which, when he approaches her mouth, he may fall and be
drowned.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Verse 6.</em>—“Oh rose, tearing thy robe in two”: that is, bursting
into flower beneath the warm breath of the wind that blows

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—When the conqueror Timur entered Shiraz it is
related that he summoned Hafiz before him and said: “Of all
my empire, Bokhara and Samarkand are the fairest jewels; how
comes it that in thy song thou hast declared that thou would’st
exchange them against the black mole on the cheek of thy
mistress?” Hafiz replied: “It is because of such generosity
that I am now as poor as thou seest.” The Emperor was not to
be outdone in repartee: he sent the poet away a richer man by
some hundreds of gold pieces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span lang="fr">C’est du Molière renversé</span>,” says Darmsteter of these lines,
and quotes:—</p>

<p class='c009'>In the garden of Mosalla, Hafiz lies buried; the stream
Ruknabad flows near at hand.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 2.</em>—The Luli or gipsies, as they were contemptuously
called, were a people of the tribe of Keredj, of Indian origin, who
inhabited the country between Shiraz and Isfahan. Their young
men and maidens were famous for their beauty and musical
accomplishments, and furnished minstrels and dancing girls to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the wealthy inhabitants of Shiraz. Sir Henry Layard met with
a similar tribe near Baghdad. “They bear,” he says, “a very
bad reputation on the score of morality, and according to
general report lead very dissolute lives. The dancing boys and
girls who frequent Baghdad, and are notoriously of evil fame,
come principally from this district. Whilst we were resting at
the caravanserai a party of them came to perform their indecent
dances before us, as they were in the habit of doing on
the arrival of travellers.”—<cite>Early Adventures.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>In Turkestan there was formerly an institution called the
Feast of Plunder. When the pay-day of the soldiers came
round, dishes of rice and great quantities of cooked food were
prepared and set out on the ground. The soldiers then rode up,
armed as if for battle, and carried off the food with mimic
violence. Thus they made reparation to their conscience for
accepting a pay lawfully earned, and reminded themselves that
rapine was their true profession.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 3.</em>—Joseph is the Oriental type of perfect beauty. The
story of his relations with Zuleikha, Potiphar’s wife, is one of
the famous love stories of the East; Jami made it the theme
of a long metaphysical poem. The part played by Zuleikha in
Persian tales is far more creditable than that which is assigned
to her either in the Bible or the Koran.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every translator of Hafiz has tried his hand upon this song,
which is one of the most famous in the Divan. It is only right
to inform the reader that the original is of great beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole poem has received a mystical interpretation which
seems to me to add but little to its value or to its intelligibility;
but in case any one should wish to gather the higher wisdom
from it, I may mention that the mole, powder, and paint, of
which a beautiful face does not stand in need, represent the ink,
colour, dots, and lines of the Koran; and this is the explanation
given to the couplet concerning Joseph and Zuleikha by a
thorough-going Western mystic: “By reason of that beauty
daily increasing that Joseph (the absolute existence, the real
beloved, God) had, I (the first day) knew that love for him
would bring Zuleikha (us, things possible) forth from the
screen of chastity (the pure existence of God).” The learned
translator seems to have felt that his version presented some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>difficulties, and he adds for the use of his weaker brethren the
following comment: “In the world of non-existence and
possibility, when I beheld the splendour of true beauty with
different qualities, I knew for certain that Love would take us
out of the ambush.” This makes everything clear.</p>

<h3 id='VII' class='c011'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—Those who have seen a Persian garden will not find
it difficult to understand why it should play so large a part in
Persian poetry. Often enough you may pass with one step out
of a barren desert of dust and stones into one of these green
and fertile spots, full of violets in the spring, and of roses and
lilies in the early summer; and from the blinding glare of a
Persian sun into a cool and shadowy retreat planted with
great plane-trees. The water which flows in numberless
streams through the garden, and leaps in countless fountains,

Oweis of Baghdad, Hadji Kawameddin, who founded a college
for Hafiz in Shiraz. With true Persian exaggeration the poet

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 6.</em>—It is related that upon a certain occasion when
Hafiz was feasting with the Vizir in the latter’s garden, a servant

suggested this verse to him. I should say that the anecdote

which pass with a better right under the name of Hafiz. It is
set to a soft and well-nigh tuneless air which sounds like dream
music, or the echo of something very beautiful coming from a
great distance, the singer ending on an almost whispered repetition
of the first exquisite phrase. I have been told that the

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 2.</em>—I have found no explanation of these difficult lines,
and, for want of a better, I venture to suggest the following:
the Garden of Irem, as has been said in the Note to Poem <a href='#II'>II</a>.,
was a mimic Paradise constructed by a certain fabulous King
Shedad, who wished to be considered a rival to his Maker by
his fellows, for which temerity a swift and sharp judgment fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>upon him; the River of Life is one of the many streams which
waters the divine Paradise. To my thinking, Hafiz takes the
one as a type of the wildest human ambition, the other as a
part of the most beautiful vision which the mind of man has
conceived. And to what does it all amount? he asks. Only
to this: that we are like to one who sits and dreams upon
the banks of a mighty and resistless river, fed from many
sources, and sings, if he be wise, his song of praise, and so
departs.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 4.</em>—The river Kausar is another of the streams of
Paradise; indeed, it is said to be the central spring from whence
all the others flow. A part of its waters are led into a great
square lake, a month’s journey in compass. On the banks of
this lake the souls of good Mahommadans rest and find refreshment
after they have crossed the terrible bridge, sharper than
the edge of a sword, which is laid over the midst of Hell. The
waters of the lake are whiter than silver and sweeter than musk.
Round it are set as many cups as there are stars in the firmament,
and he who has drunk of it shall thirst no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sidreh and Tuba are two trees in the Garden of Paradise.
The former is the abode of the angel Gabriel. Concerning the

Mahommad, though a branch of it will reach to the house of
every true believer; that it will be laden with pomegranates,
grapes, dates, and other fruits of surprising bigness, and of
tastes unknown to mortals. So that if a man desire to eat of
any particular kind of fruit, it will immediately be presented to
him; or if he choose flesh, birds ready dressed will be set before
him, according to his wish. They add that the boughs of this
tree will spontaneously bend down to the hand of the person
who would gather of its fruits, and that it will supply the blessed
not only with food, but also with silken garments and beasts to
ride on, ready saddled and bridled and adorned with rich trappings,

<p class='c009'>“Khizr,” a prophet whom the Mahommadans confound with
Phineas, Elias, and St. George, saying that his soul passed by
metempsychosis successively through all three. He discovered
the fountain of life and drank of it, thereby making himself immortal.
It is said that he guided Alexander to the same fountain,
which lay in the Land of Darkness. It was he, too, for
whom Moses set out to seek when he had been informed by God
that Al Khizr was wiser than he. He found him seated on a
rock, at the meeting of the two seas, and followed him for a
time, learning wisdom from him, as is related in the eighteenth
chapter of the Koran. His name signifies Green; wherever his
feet rested, the earth was covered with green herbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hafiz looked upon the prophet Al Khizr as one of his special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>guardians. About four Persian miles from Shiraz there is a
spot called Pir-i-Sabz, the Old Green Man; whosoever should
pass forty nights in it without sleeping, on the fortieth night
Al Khizr would appear to him and confer upon him the immortal
gift of song. Hafiz in his youth fell in love with a
beautiful girl of Shiraz called Shakh-i-Nahat, and in order to
win her heart he determined to meet Al Khizr and receive from
him the art of poetry. For thirty-nine mornings he walked
beneath the windows of Shakh-i-Nahat, at noon he ate, then he
slept, and at night he kept watch, undismayed by the terrible
apparition of a fierce lion which was his nightly companion. At
length, on the fortieth morning, Shakh-i-Nahat called him into
her house and told him that she was ready to become his
wife, for she preferred a man of genius to the son of a king.
She would have kept him with her, but Hafiz, though he had
gained his original end, was now filled with desire to become a
poet, and insisted upon keeping his fortieth vigil. That night
an old man dressed in green garments came to him and brought
him a cup of the water of immortality.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 5.</em>—“Narrow-eyedness” is the exact translation of the
Persian word for greed, and there is consequently, in the original,
a play of meaning between the physical and moral attributes
of the Tartars.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is significant that Hafiz should choose the “narrow-eyed”
Tartar robbers as types of cruelty. Just as the Anglo-Saxons
prayed to be delivered from the Danes, so a clause in the Persian
litany of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries might have
been: “From the power of the Tartars, good Lord, deliver us!”
First under Hulagu, and then under Timur, they overran and
devastated Persia. The destruction wrought by them was very
similar to that wrought by the Arab conquerors in the Roman
provinces of North Africa. They rased to the ground great
cities; they reduced populous and fertile regions to a barren
desert by breaking down the old reservoirs and destroying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>irrigating system, completely changing the physical conditions
of parts of the country. In the mountains to the north of
Tehran, for instance, there are villages bearing names the
etymology of which points to their having stood at the outlet
of a reservoir of which no other trace remains, and it is said
that the country surrounding the town was far more thoroughly
irrigated before the Tartar invasion, and supported a larger
population. The invaders completely destroyed the ancient
city of Rhages, which lay at a distance of about three miles
from the modern capital. The same thing happened in North
Africa. The ruins of Roman towns are to be found in country
which must once have been fertile, but which is now reconquered
by the sands of the Sahara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One poor robe.” The Persian runs: “man dervish-i-yek kaba”—<em>i.e.</em>
I, a poor man of one robe—<em>dervish</em> signifying in its primary
sense, it is hardly necessary to say, <em>poor</em>. I should think that
the double meaning is significant. In its mystical sense, the
poem describes how Hafiz found consolation in the ecstatic
drunkenness of the Sufis, in the minstrel’s song, or divine
message, which brought him a word from God; and when
finally the last shred of his orthodoxy had been torn from him,
when in his desperate struggle with existence he was forced to
abandon even his dervish robe, Heaven mercifully showed him
a safe refuge in the Sufi doctrines.</p>

<h3 id='XXI' class='c011'>XXI</h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—Sir Henry Layard gives the following account of
a party of dervishes with whom he travelled, from which it
would appear that the contempt of Hafiz for the dervish habit
was not wholly uncalled for: “They were a picturesque and
motley crew. One or two of them were what the Persians call
<em>luti</em>, young men with well-dyed curls, long garments, and
conical caps embroidered in many colours—debauched and
dissolute fellows, who, under the guise of poverty, and affecting
abstinence and piety, were given to every manner of vice.
Others were half-naked savages, with hair hanging down their
backs, and the skins of gazelles on their shoulders—barefooted,
dirty, and covered with vermin. They carried heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>iron maces, and seemed more disposed to exact than to ask for
charity. As they went along they shouted ‘Yah Allah! yah
Muhammad! yah Ali!’ They all had slung from their shoulders
the carved cocoa-nut shell, which is indispensable to the
dervish, and serves for carrying food and for drinking purposes.
Round their necks they wore charms and amulets, with beads
and coloured strings and tassels.” He goes on to say: “Most
Persian dervishes, although they have great pretensions to
sanctity, by which they impose upon the people, high and low,
are without any religion. They are, however, credited with
working miracles, and with being able to give efficacious
charms.... Although these dervishes are rank impostors,
and generally arrant scoundrels, they maintain their influence
over the ignorant and superstitious Persians of all classes, who
greatly fear, and do not dare to offend them. Consequently no
one ventures to refuse them admission into their houses, and
even into the women’s apartments, where those who go stark-naked,
and are looked upon as specially holy and protected by
Allah and Ali, can enter with impunity. Sometimes they will
demand a specific sum of money from a rich man, and if he
refuses to pay it, will establish themselves in the gateway or
porch of his dwelling, or outside close to it, and enclosing a
small plot of ground, sow wheat or plant flowers, and remain
until what they ask for is paid them, hooting hideously day and
night, calling upon Mohammad, Ali, and the Imams, or blowing
on a buffalo’s horn so as to disturb the whole neighbourhood.
The owner and inmates of the house are helpless. They do not
dare to remove by force the holy men.”—<cite>Early Adventures.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 2.</em>—That is to say, the prayer carpet of the orthodox
Mussulman had not enough value to procure for him so much as
one glass of Sufi wine. Nor was he worthy to lay his head even
upon the dusty steps of the tavern—the place of instruction,
in Sufi doctrine.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 3.</em>—To be clothed in one colour is the Persian idiom
for sincerity. He means that the single purple robe of the
grape is worth more than the hypocritical garment of the

wrong road.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span><em>Stanza 5.</em>—So far I have endeavoured to give the mystical
interpretation of the poem. There is, however, a story attached
to it which turns it into a historical rather than a theological
document. It is related that the King of the Deccan, Mahmud
Shah Bahmani, had heard of the fame of Hafiz, and having a
pretty taste in literature, was desirous of attracting him to his
court. Accordingly he ordered his Vizir, Mir Feiz Allah Inju,
to send the poet a sufficient sum to pay for his journey from
Shiraz. Hafiz resolved to accept the invitation. He wound up
his affairs in his native town, using some of the money the
Sultan had sent him in paying his debts and in making gifts to
his sister’s children, and set forth upon his journey. But when
he reached the town of Lar he found there an acquaintance in
very bad case, having been plundered by robbers and reduced
to a state of beggary. Hafiz was moved to compassion and gave
him the remainder of the money which Mahmud Shah had sent
to him. He was now himself unable to continue his journey
for want of means, and perhaps it was bitter experience that
taught him that in very fact his prayer carpet would not fetch
him a glass of wine, and that without the necessary silver pieces
he would be thrust from out the tavern doors. From these
straits he was rescued by two friendly merchants, who were
also on their way to India, and who offered to pay his expenses
to Hormuz, and there place him on a vessel of Mahmud Shah’s
which was coming to fetch them. Hafiz accepted the offer,
went to Hormuz, and embarked on the ship. But before they
had left the port a violent storm arose, and persuaded the poet
that no advantages he might reap from the journey would be
worth the sorrow of the sea. Under pretext of bidding farewell
to some friends, he disembarked, and in all haste made the best
of his way back to Shiraz, sending to Feiz Allah this poem as
an excuse for failing to keep his engagement. The Vizir read
it to Mahmud Shah, who was transported by the beauty of the
verses and the philosophic dignity in which Hafiz had cloaked
his fears of the dangers of the road and the discomforts of seasickness.
With singular generosity he sent the defaulting poet
a further present, consisting of some at least of the riches of his
lands and seas.</p>

was not always on the best of terms with Hafiz, partly
because he was jealous of the latter’s fame as a poet, and
partly because Hafiz had been the protégé of Shah Shudja’s
former rival, Abu Ishac. Accordingly the King looked about
for some means of doing the poet an injury, nor was it long
before he found what he sought. He accused Hafiz of denying
the Resurrection, basing the accusation upon the last couplet
of this poem—the last three lines of the present translation—and
cited him before the Ulema as an infidel. But Hafiz was
too many for him. Before the day on which he was to answer
the charge against himself, he inserted another couplet into
the ode, in which he stated that the dangerous lines did not
express his own opinion, but that of a heretical Christian. He
came off with flying colours; for not only was he entirely cleared,
but it was also acknowledged that he had dealt a good blow on
behalf of the Mahommadan religion, since he had shown up one
of the errors of the infidel.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—There are many ways of taking omens which are
still practised by the Persians. Concerning astrology and
geomancy Mr. Browne questioned a learned Persian, and received
the reply that there was positive proof of their truth.
The Persian added, however, that the study of these sciences
was very difficult, and many who professed to be acquainted
with them were mere charlatans. Many dreams also, he said,
were capable of interpretation, and might furnish indications
to events which were yet to come. Mr. Browne relates that
he consulted a geomancer, who, by means of dice, gave him
much information as to his future—none of which has yet been
justified by the event—but on being asked to perform the less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>difficult task of answering some questions as to his past, turned
the conversation into other channels. “I discussed,” says the
traveller, “the occult sciences with several of my friends, to
discover as far as possible the prevailing opinion among them.”
One of them made use of the following argument to prove their
existence: “God,” he said, “has no <em>bukhl</em> (avarice); it is
impossible for Him to withhold from any one a thing for which
he strives with sufficient earnestness. Just as if a man devotes
all his energies to the pursuit of spiritual knowledge he attains
to it, so if he chooses to make occult sciences and magical
powers the object of his aspirations they will assuredly not be
withheld from him.”—<cite>A Year Amongst the Persians.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>An omen can be taken by opening the Koran or some other
well-accredited book (the Divan of Hafiz among the number),
pricking a pin into the page, and following whatever directions
can be drawn from the verse thus indicated. This method is
frequently used before setting out upon a journey. The stars
also are consulted in order to select a favourable day for
embarking upon any enterprise, certain stars having special
influence over men—the influence of the moon, for instance,
is dangerous to life, and one of the stars in the constellation
of Cassiopea is of evil presage. Besides these omens, divinations
are taken from the movements and position of certain
animals and birds, and from various passing events. To meet
a one-eyed man is of bad omen, especially if he is blind of the
left eye, or to hear an unlucky word on setting out from your
house of a morning. Lane, in one of his notes to the “Arabian
Nights,” tells of a Sultan who was setting out on a raid, when
one of his standards happening to strike against a cluster (or
Pleiades, as they are called in Arabic) of lamps, he regarded
this to be of evil import, and was about to abandon the expedition.
“Oh our lord!” said one of his officers, “our standards
have reached the Pleiades.” The Sultan, encouraged by
this fortunate suggestion, continued on his way, and returned
victorious.</p>

Parwiz who conquered Jerusalem, and carried off, say the
Persians, the true Cross, which had been enclosed in a gold
box and buried in the ground. He was devotedly attached to
his wife Shirin, but she had given her heart to her humble
lover Ferhad. He, despairing of ever reaching one whose rank
had placed her so far above him, wandered through the deserts
and the mountains of Persia calling upon her name, and in
order to beguile his weary hours executed the sculptures upon
the rock Behistun—so says the legend. At length the King
sent to him and told him that if he would cut through the rock
and cause a stream upon the other side of the mountains to
flow through it, he would relinquish Shirin to him. Ferhad set
himself to the task, and had almost accomplished it when
Khusro sent him the false news of Shirin’s death. On hearing
it, Ferhad threw himself from the top of the rock and so died.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Shirin’s end was scarcely less tragic. Khusro Parwiz was put
to a violent death by his son, who proceeded to make proposals
of marriage to his father’s widow. Shirin promised to marry
him if he would allow her to see once more her husband’s
corpse. She was led to the place where the murdered King lay,
and drawing a dagger, she stabbed herself and fell dead across
his body.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 2.</em>—The quarter of Jafrabad has ceased to exist. Its
position was to the east of the town, opposite to the fields and
to the ruined mosque of Mosalla. Between Jafrabad and Mosalla
runs the highroad to Isfahan, traversing, at the distance of a

<p class='c009'>The angel Gabriel, the Holy Spirit, is the highest of all the
angels. It is his duty to write down the decrees of God;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>through him the Koran was revealed to Mahommad, and it is
he who, hovering above the throne of God, shelters it with his
wings. Hafiz therefore claims for Shiraz the protection of him
who is guardian of the highest place in heaven.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ibn Batuta, the Arab traveller who visited Shiraz about the
year 1340, has left a charming description of the native town of
Hafiz and of the manners of his contemporaries. “Shiraz,” he
says, “is a well-built town of a great size, a wide celebrity, and
a high place among cities. It possesses pleasant gardens, far-reaching
streams, excellent markets, fine streets, and a numerous
population. The town is constructed with taste and admirably
arranged; each trade has its own bazaar. The inhabitants are
a fine race and well clad. Shiraz lies in a plain; gardens surround
it on every side; and five rivers flow through it, amongst them
one called Ruknabad, a stream of which the water is excellent
to drink, very cold in summer and warm in winter. The principal
mosque is called the Old Mosque; it is as spacious and as
well built as any one could wish to see. The court of it is vast
and paved with marble; in hot weather it is washed with fresh
water every night. The wealthy citizens come there every
evening to repeat the prayers of sunset and of night. The inhabitants
of Shiraz are well-to-do, pious, and chaste; the women
in particular are distinguished for their modesty. They go
completely veiled, give much in alms, and repair three times a
week to the great mosque. Often as many as two thousand are
assembled there, sitting with fans in their hands on account of
the great heat. Each day in one of the mausoleums the whole
Koran is read aloud, and the readers have very beautiful voices.
The people bring with them fruits and sweetmeats, and when
the congregation has finished eating, the preacher begins his
discourse. This takes place between the mid-day and the evening
prayers.” Ibn Batuta struck up acquaintance with a Sheikh
whom he found seated in a small hermitage at the corner of a
mosque. The Sheikh was engaged in reading the Koran. In
answer to Ibn Batuta’s questions, he told him that he had
founded the mosque himself, and that the hermitage was to be
his tomb. Lifting a carpet, he showed him his grave, covered
over with planks. “In that box,” he said, pointing to a chest
opposite to him, “are my winding-sheet, some spices with which
my corpse will be perfumed, and a few pieces of money which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>earned by digging a well for a pious man. The money will
serve to pay for my burial, and what is left over will be distributed
among the poor.” “I admired his conduct,” adds Ibn
Batuta. “One of the mausoleums outside the town,” he continues,
“contains the tomb of Sheikh Sa’di, the first poet of his
time. Close at hand is a hermitage built by Sa’di himself, surrounded
by a charming garden. It is situated near the source
of the Ruknabad. In the garden Sheikh Sa’di constructed a
number of basins for the washing of clothes. The citizens of
Shiraz make parties of pleasure to this mausoleum; they eat
food prepared in the hermitage, wash their garments in the
river, and at sunset return to the town. So did I also. May
God have mercy on Shiraz!” he concludes piously.</p>

the Prophet decreed that from two hours before dawn until

do they refrain from eating and drinking, but they will not even

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—The story of the creation of Adam, and of the part
played in it by the angels, is told by Mahommad in the following
terms: “When thy Lord said unto the angels, I am going to
place a substitute on earth; they said, Wilt thou place there
one who will do evil therein, and shed blood? but we celebrate
thy praise and sanctify thee. God answered, Verily I know
that which ye know not; and he taught Adam the names of all
things, and then proposed them to the angels, and said, Declare
unto me the names of these things if ye say truth. They answered,
Praise be unto thee, we have no knowledge but what
thou teachest us, for thou art knowing and wise. God said,
Oh Adam, tell them their names. And when he had told them
their names, God said, Did I not tell you that I know the secrets
of heaven and earth, and know that which ye discover and that
which ye conceal? And when we said unto the angels, Worship
Adam; they all worshipped him, except Eblis, who refused, and
was puffed up with pride, and became of the number of unbelievers.”—<cite>Koran</cite>,
chap. ii.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tradition has amplified and adorned this story. It is said
that the three archangels, Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil, were
each in turn ordered to take from the earth seven handfuls of
clay of three different colours, red, white, and yellow, that God
might create out of it the races of mankind. But each in turn
was moved by the earth’s prayer that he would not rob her of
her substance, and each returned to heaven empty-handed.
The fourth time God sent Azrail, the angel of death, who tore
the seven handfuls from the earth, but hearing her lamentations,
promised her that when man ceased to live his substance
should return to the earth from whence it had been taken.
With the clay that Azrail brought him God moulded the figure
of man, and when it was finished he left it forty days to dry.
The angels came often to gaze upon it, and Eblis, kicking it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>with his foot, found that it rang hollow. When the figure of clay
was dry, God breathed the breath of life into its nostrils, and
ordered the angels to submit to the man he had created. But
Eblis refused, saying that he had been created of pure fire, and
would not serve a hollow mould of clay; for which reason God
cast him out of Paradise. The rest of the angels acknowledged
the superiority of Adam after God had made him tell them the
names of all the creatures of the earth, though they had at first
protested that it was not seemly that they should bow down to
him, for their love for God was greater than his. It is with this
legend in his mind that Hafiz speaks of the angels as standing
at the tavern door, where man may enter and receive instruction
in God’s wisdom, but where they must knock in vain, and
as moulding a wine-cup with the despised clay out of which the
human body was moulded. I think he means that man himself
is the vessel into which divine love and wisdom are poured; and
when he says that the angels first brought him wine, he means
that by their example they showed him what it was to be intoxicated
by the contemplation of God.</p>

the Oriental way of writing a letter of thanks. At the same
time, in spite of this rational explanation, it must be acknowledged
that the meaning of the name Zindeh Rud is River of

<p class='c009'>The word bezoar comes from two Arabic roots which signify the
annihilator of poison. Murray gives several examples of its use
by seventeenth and eighteenth century writers in the sense of
an antidote, chiefly to snake bites. Topsell, for instance, in his
book on Serpents (1607), remarks that “the juice of apples being
drunk, and endive, are the proper Bezoar against the venom
of a Phalangie”—whatever that may be. The word was also
applied to various substances held as antidotes, especially to a
concretion found in the stomach of some animals, formed of
concentric layers of animal matter deposited round some foreign
substance. This concretion was called the bezoar stone. The
original sort was the lapis bezoar orientale obtained from the
wild goat of Persia, which was in later times called the bezoar
goat; also from various antelopes, &#38;c. The lapis bezoar occidentale,
obtained from the llamas of Peru, was less valued. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>chamois yielded German bezoar. “The stone,” says Frampton,
in his “Joyful News,” “is called the Bezaar, being approved good
against Venome”; and Hawkins, in his “Voyage to the South
Seas,” talks about “the becunia and other beasts which breed
the beazer stone.”</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Stanza 1.</em>—It is related that Ghiyasuddin Purabi, who succeeded
his father to the throne of Bengal in the year 1367, fell sick.
During his illness he was nursed by three faithful handmaidens
whose names were Cypress, Tulip, and Rose, and owing to their
care he eventually recovered. The rest of the Sultan’s ladies
were jealous of the gratitude that the three maidens had earned
from Ghiyasuddin, and nicknamed them contemptuously “the
three bath women,” because they had washed the King’s body
while he was ill. He therefore determined to do them honour
by commemorating their devotion in a poem, and to this end he
composed the first line of a couplet, and ordered the poets of
his court to complete the ode. The line ran thus: “Sàki hadisi-sarvo
gul o làleh miravad”—Cup-bearer, a tale runs of a Cypress,
a Rose, and a Tulip. But the poets were unable to perform the
task to the King’s satisfaction, and at length some one suggested
that the line should be sent to Hafiz of Shiraz, the fame of whose
great skill had reached Bengal. This was accordingly done,
and Hafiz composed the ode here translated, with which the
Sultan (whose taste seems to have turned towards the discursive
in poetry) was much delighted. The three cups of wine
are an allusion to the three maidens who washed the King’s
body; the parrots of India are the court poets of Ghiyasuddin,
and the Persian sweetmeat is the ode that Hafiz sent to
Bengal.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 4.</em>—Samir. Al Samiri belonged, say the Mahommadans,
to a certain tribe among the Jews called the Samaritans,
whence his name. In this the Mahommadans strangely betray
their ignorance of history, for the Samaritans were not formed
into a people, nor did they bear that name, until many ages
later. Some say that he was a proselyte, but a hypocritical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>one, and originally of Kerman or some other country. “His
real name was Musa ibn Dhafar. He was a magician and an
alchemist. Pharaoh employed him as a rival to Moses when the
latter worked miracles with his hand and his staff, but Al Samiri
was unable to show wonders as great as those performed by
Moses. It was he and not Aaron, according to Mahommadan
tradition, who cast the golden calf. The calf was made of the
ornaments of gold and silver and other materials which the
Israelites had borrowed from the Egyptians; for Aaron, who
commanded in his brother’s absence, having ordered Al Samiri
to collect those ornaments from the people, who carried on a
wicked commerce with them, and to keep them together till the
return of Moses, Al Samiri, understanding the founder’s art, put
them all together into a furnace, to melt them down into one
mass, which came out in the form of a calf. The Israelites,
accustomed to the Egyptian idolatry, paying a religious worship
to this image, Al Samiri went further, and took some
dust from the footsteps of the horse of the angel Gabriel,
who marched at the head of the people, and threw it into
the mouth of the calf, which immediately began to low, and
became animated; for such was the virtue of that dust.”
(Sale, Notes to second and twenty-second chapters of the
Koran.) Al Samiri is mentioned by name in the twenty-second
chapter of the Koran: “Al Samiri led them astray.”</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Stanza 3.</em>—Zohra is the planet Venus, the musician of the
heavens, and the protector of all musicians and singers upon
the earth. Zohra played a part in very ancient mythology.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The Mahommadans borrowed and adapted the Magian legends
concerning her, and their account runs as follows: Once upon
a time the angels fell to marvelling over the wickedness of man
and the ease with which he was led astray, notwithstanding the
warnings sent down to him through the prophets. But God, hearing
their words, determined to expose them also to temptation,
that they might learn how easy it was to fall. Therefore he
appointed two of them, whose names were Harut and Marut, to
go down to the earth as judges over man, and he taught them a
secret word by the power of which every evening, when their
work of judgment was done, they could return to heaven. For
some time the two angels accomplished their duties faithfully.
But at length a woman called Zohra, more beautiful than any
other woman upon earth, came before their judgment-seat demanding
redress against her husband, and the two angels conceived
a violent passion for her. On the following day, when
she returned with the same petition, they drew her aside and
declared their love to her. She replied that she would satisfy
their desires if they would do three things: destroy her husband,
worship the gods she worshipped, and drink wine. Murderers
and idolaters the angels could not agree to become, but they
consented to drink wine, “not knowing,” says the Persian commentator
of the Mesnavi of Jelaleddin Rumi, “that wine was
the source of sin and the mother of shame.” Then said Zohra:
“Every night, by the power of a divine word, ye return to
heaven. Teach me also that word.” The angels confided to
her the secret of God, and as soon as she had heard the word
she pronounced it in her turn and rose up into heaven, where
God changed her form and turned her into a star. The angels
attempted to follow her to heaven, but they were refused admittance.
On the intercession of a very pious man, however,
they were allowed to choose whether they would be punished in
this world or the next; they chose the former, and now suffer
punishment in the land of Babel—whither, if any man have a
mind to learn magic, he may go and learn it of them, for they
are masters of all magic arts. Tradition says that Mahommad,
whenever he looked upon the planet Venus, was wont to exclaim:
“God curse Zohra! for it was she who led the two angels Harut
and Marut into sin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The same story, says Rosenzweig, is to be found in the Talmud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>where the two angels are called Asa and Asail. The Talmud
relates that the angels, after their sin, were carried into a great
mountain and suspended by chains over an abyss. It was they
who taught Solomon wisdom.</p>
